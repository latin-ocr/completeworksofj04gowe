 

NOTES. Lm. lv. 179-723 391

Our author has interchanged the sexes for the purpose of his
argument, the man being represented as a helpless victim.

450. The subject to be supplied must be ‘agnus.'

451. Cp. Ars Amat. iii. 419.

453 f. Tristia, i. 6. 9f.

461-466. De Vita Monaclmrum, p. 188.

469-490. N early the whole of this is taken from Neckam, p. 178.

537 f. Cp. Ovid, Rem. Amoris, 235 f.‚

‘Adspicis ut prensos urant iuga prima iuvencos,
Et nova velocem cingula laedat equum?’

575. Cp. Amores, iii. 4. 17.

587. ‘ Genius ’ is here introduced as the priest of Venus and in l. 597
in the character of a confessor, as afterwards in the Confessio Amantjs.
The reference to the ‘ poets' in the marginal note can hardly be merely
to the Roman de la Rose, where Genius is the priest and confessor of
Nature, but the variation ‘secundum Ouidium' of the Glasgow MS.
does not seem to be justified by any passage of Ovid. The connexion
with Venus obviously has to do with the elassical idea of Genius as
a god who presides over the begetting of children: cp. Isid. Etym.
viii. 88. The marginal note in S is written in a hand probably different

from that of the text, but contemporary.
617 f. Cp. Ars Amat. ii. 649 f.‚

‘Dum novus in viridi coalescit cortice ramus,
Concutiat tenerum quaelibet aura, cadet.⁷

623. Spiritus est promptus, ἃς. Gower apparently took this text to
mean, ‘the spirit is ready to do evil, andthe flesh is weak ' z cp. Λίίνοῑιν,
14165.

624. Cp. Mirour, 16768.

637. For this use of ‘quid ’ cp. that of‘numquid,' ii. Prol. 59, and
v. 279.

648. Rev. xiv. 4, ⁴ Hi sequuntur agnum . . . quocunque ierit!

657 f. Apparently referring to Rev, xii. 14.

659. Cp. the Latin Verses after Confessio Amanlzk, v. 6358.

681 f. Cp. Ovid, Pont. iv. 4. 3f.

689 ff. Cp. Mz'rour de l’Omme, 21266‚ margin.

699. sore: used here and elsewhere by our author for ‘esse’; see
below, l. 717, and v, 763.

715. Aceplzalmn. This name was applied in early times to eccle-
siastics who were exempt from the authority of the bishop : see
Ducange. The word is differently used in iii. 956, and by comparison
with that passage we might be led to suppose that there was some
reference here to the ‘inopes ² and ‘ opem ’ of the next line.

723 ff. Compare with this the contemporary accounts of the contro-
versy between F itzRalph, archbishop of Armagh, and the Mendicant
Friars, who are said to have bribed the Pope to confirm their privileges
