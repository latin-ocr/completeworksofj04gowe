376 vox CLAMANTIS

951. Ovid, Fasti, vi. 673.

953. stlelam. xv. 665.

955 f. That is, the deeds of Friday (dies Veneris) were more
atrocious than those of Thursday.

961 f. The construction of accusative with infinitive is here used after
‘Ecce,' as if it were a verb, and ‘Calcas' is evidently meant for an
accusative case. It is probable that the names here given, Calchas,
Antenor, Thersites, Diomede, Ulysses, as well as those which follow in
11. 985 ff„ are meant to stand for general types, rather than for particular
persons connected with the governrnent. In any case we could hardly
identify them.

997. Vix Hecube thalami, &a This looks like an allusion to the
princess of VValeS‚ the king’s mother, whose apartments in the Tower
were in fact invaded by the mob. Similarly in the lines that follow
‘ Helenus ’ stands sor the archbishop of Canterbury.

1019 ff. The text of these five lines, as we find it in DTH2, that is in

its earlier form, was taken for the most part from the A uram of Petrus
(de) Riga, (MS. Bodley 822) f. 88 νο,

‘Non rannus pungens, set oliua uirens, set odora
Ficus, set blanda uitis abhorret eos.

Anticristus enirn regit hos, nam spiritus almus,
Nam lex, nam Cristus, non dominatur eis.'

He is speaking of the parable ofJotham in the Book of Judges.

1046. Fasti, ii. 228. ·

1073. mediaque: written apparently for ‘ mediaque.’

1076. posse caret, ‘ is without effect?

1081. Cp. Tristia, iv. 2. 5 f.

1094. Cp. Fasti, i. 122.

1141. lllelam. vi. 559.

1143. Cp. flffetam. vii. 603.

1161. Aletum. vii. 602. Considering that the line is borrowed from
Ovid, we cannot attach much importanee to it as indicating what was
done with the body of the archbishop.

1173. oslz'a iuris: cp. VValsingham, i. 457, ‘locum qui vocatur

“Temple Barre,’' in quo apprenticii iuris morabantur nobiliores,
diruerunt.'

1188. Cp. Ovid, Her. iii. 4.
1189. stletam. v. 41.

1193 f. Cp. Ars Amat. ii. 373 s., where, however, we have ‘cum rotat,’
not ‘conrotat.’

1206. Quam periturus erat, ‘rather than that he should perish‚’
apparently.

1209. Cp. Metam. v. 40.
1211. lllclam. xiv. 408.

1215 f. A reference probably to the massacre of the Flemings.
1219 f. Fasti, iii. 509 f.
