The second of the parchment blanks at the beginning has a note in the
original hand of the MS. on the marriage of the devil and the birth of his
nine daughters, who were assigned to various classes of human society,
Simony to the prelates‚ Hypocrisy to the religious orders, and so on. At
the end of the book there are two leaves with theological and other notes in
the same hand, and two cut sor purposes of binding from leaves osan older
MS. of Latin hymns, &a with music.

L2. L1NCOLN CATHEDRAL LIBRARY, A. 72, very obligingly placed
at my disposal in the Bodleian by the Librarian, with authority from the
Dean and Chapter. Contains the same as L, including the enigmatical
lines above quoted. Paper, ff. 184, measuring about 8 >< 6 in. neatly
written in an early sixteenth-century hand, about 26 lines to the page.
No coloured initials, but space left for them and on f. 21 sor a picture
corresponding to that on f.21 of the Laud MS. Neither books nor
chapters numbered. Marked in pencil as ‘one of Dean Honywood’s,
No. 53!

Certainly copied from L, giving a precisely similar form of text and
agreeing almost always in the minutest details.

T. TRINITY COLLEGE‚ DUBLIN, D. 4, 6, kindly sent to the Bodleian
for my use by the Librarian, with the authority of the Provost and
Fellows. Contains Vox Cla77zantz‘s without Table of Chapters,
followed by the account of the author’s books, ‘ Quia vnusquisque,’ ἃς.
Parchment‚ ff. 144 (two blank) in seventeen quires, usually of eight
leaves, but the first and sixteenth of ten and thelast of twelve; written
in an early fifteenth-century hand, 36—39 lines to the page, no passages
erased or rewritten. Coloured initials.

This, in agreement with the Hatfield book (lh), gives the original form
of all the passages which were revised or rewritten. It is apparently
a careless copy of a good text, with many mistakes, some of which are
corrected. The scribe either did not understand what he was writing
or did not attend to the meaning, and a good many lines and couplets
have been carelessly dropped out, as i. 873, 1360, 1749, 1800, ii. Prol. 24 f.,
ii. 561 f., iii. 281, 394 f., 943 f., 1154, 1767-1770‚ 1830, iv. 516 f., 684, v.
142-145, 528-53o‚ vi. 829 f., vii. 688 f., 1099 f.

The blank leaf at the beginning, which is partly cut away, has in an early
hand the lines

‘In Kent alle car by gan, ibi pauci sunt sapientes,
In a Route thise Rebaudis ran sua trepida arma gerentes,'

for which cp. Wright’s Political Poems, Rolls Series, 14, vol. i. p. 225.
