LIFE OF GOWER xiii

to the transaction between John Gower and John Spenythorn
with Joanna his wife, we must be content to remain rather in the
dark. John Gower had in the year before acquired Kentwell in
full possession for himself and his heirs, and he must in the mean
time have alienated it, and now apparently acquired it again. 1t is
hardly likely that the Joan who is here mentioned is the same as
Joan daughter of Sir Robert Gower, ‘who was married successively
to William Neve and Thomas Syward. On the other hand it
must be regarded as probable that the John Gower of this
document is identical with the John Gower who acquired Kentwell
from Thomas Syward and his wife in 1368. The confirmation in
the king's court, 3 Ric. ΙΙ, was perhaps by way of verifying the
title before the grant of Kentwell by Sir J. Cobham to Sir
T. Clopton‚ 4 Ric. II.

47 Ed. ΙΙΙ (1373). John Gower grants his manor of Kentwell
in Suffolk to Sir John Cobham and his heirs 3 a deed executed at
Otford in Kent, Thurs. Sept. 29 ¹.

48 Ed. III (1374). Payment of 12 marks by Sir J. Cobham
on acquisition of Kentwell and half of Aldyngton from john
Gower ².

By this last document it seems pretty certain that the John
Gower from whom Sir J. Cobham received Kentwell was the same
person as the John Gower who acquired Aldyngton from William
Septvans 3 and he is proved to be a relation of the poet, as well as
of Sir Robert Gower, by the fact that the arms on the seal of
John Gower, attached to the deed by which Kentwell was alien-
ated‚ are apparently the same as those which were placed upon
Sir Rob. Gower's tomb at Brabonme, and those which we see
on the poet’s tomb in Southwark ³. These persons, then, belonged
to the same family, so far as we can judge3 but evidently it is
not proved merely by this fact that the John Gower mentioned
in the above document was identical with the poet. We have
seen already that the name was not uncommon in Kent, and
there are some further considerations which may lead us to

¹ Harl. Charters, 501. 14. The deed is given in full by Nicolas in the
Retrospective Revzew.

² Rot. Orzjg. 48 Ed. 111. 31.

³ The tinctures are not indicated either upon the drawing of Sir R. Gower-'s
coat ofarms in MS. Harl. 3917 or on the seal, but the eoat seems to be the same,
three leopards' faces upon a chevron. The seal has a diaper pattern on the
shield that bears the chevron, but this is probably only ornamental.
