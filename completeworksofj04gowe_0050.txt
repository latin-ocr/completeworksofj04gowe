xl GOWER'S LATIN WORKS

low by violence; strife and bloodshed reign here ever. Yet if they
could love one another, no better people would there be from the rising
to the setting of the sun.’

I was saddened and terrified by his answer, I knew not whether sea
or land were more to be feared. The heavenly voice which I had
heard before said to me, ‘ Lament not, but take heed to thyself. Thou
hast come to a place where wars abmmd, but do thou seek peace within
by God's assistance. Be cautious and silent3 but when thou hast
leisure, record these dreams of thine, for dreams often give a presage
of the future! The voice was heard no more, and at that moment the
cock crew and I awoke from my sleep, scarce knowing whether what
I had seen was within me or without.

CAP. XXI. Then Ι returned thanks to God for having preserved
me upon the sea and frorn the jaws of Scylla. The rustic goes back to
his labours, but in his heart there remains hatred of his lords; there-
fore let us be forewarned and provide against future evils. As for me,
God has set me free from the danger, and for this Ι thank him; and
I would that my country, preserved from destruction, might render due
thanks to God. While the mernory of these things is fresh in me, Ι will
write that which Ι experienced in my sleep, that waking slumber which
brought to me no mere vision but a dream of reality.

PROLOGUS LIBRI SECUNDI.

Many things did 1 see and note, which my pen shall write, but first Ι
invoke, not the Muses, but the true Spirit of God, and I will let down my
nets in the name of Christ and for his glory. The style and the verses
are poor, but the meaning is good. I will give that which rny poor
faculties can attain to ; and may he be my helper who produced speech
from the mouth of an ass. I prefer to do a little good than none.

The words which follow are not spoken from myself ; they are
gathered from various sources, as honey from various flowers or
bright shells from various shores. The name of the book is Vox
Clamanlz's, because it is the utterance of a fresh sorrOW.

LIBER SECUNDUS.

CAP. I. Tears shall be the ink with which I write. All is vanity
except the love of God, and man has cause for lamentation from his
birth.

Yet if any people in the world could be happy, God granted this boon
to us ; we were blessed above all other nations. Now our former glory
is extinguished and our prosperity is destroyed.

Why is our condition thus changed? Nothing on earth happens
without a cause, yet all deny that they are the cause of this and find
fault with Fortune‚ who turns all things upside down.
