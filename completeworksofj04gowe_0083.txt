handwriting in his authority, which moreover is grossly incorrect.
Not being acquainted with Dublin or the Hatfield MSS„ he
could not give the original text of such passages as Vox clamantis,
iii. 1-28 or vi. 545—80‚ but he might at least have indicated the
lines which he found written over erasure, and in different hands
from the original text, in the All Souls and Cotton MSS. Dr.
Karl Meyer again, who afterwards paid some attention to the
handwriting and called attention to Coxe’s misstatement on the
subject, was preoccupied with the theory that the revision took
place altogether after the accession of Henry IV, and failed to note
the evidence afforded by the differences of handwriting for the
conclusion that the revision was a gradual one, made in accordance
with the development of political events.

Ι think it well to indicate the chief differences of text between the
Roxburghe edition of the Vox Clamantis and the present. The read-
ings in the following list are those of the Roxburghe edition. In
cases where the Roxburghe editor has followed the All Souls or Digby
MS. that fact is noted by the letters S or D ; but the variations are for
the most part mere mistakes. It should be noted also that the sense
is very often obscured in the Roxburghe edition by bad punctuation,
ancl that the medieval spelling is usually not preserved.
