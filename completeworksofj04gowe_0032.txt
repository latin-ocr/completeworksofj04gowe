xxii INTRODUCTION

‘Beside on the wall, whereas he lieth, there be painted three
virgins with crowns on their heads, one of the which is written
Charitie, and she holdeth this device in her hand,

En toy qui es fitz de dieu le pere¹
Sauve soit que gist souz cest piere.

‘The second is written Mercye, which holdeth in her hand this

device, O bone jesu, fait ta mercy

Al alme dont le corps gist icy ².

‘The third of them is written Pite‚ which holdeth in her hand
this device following,

Pur ta pite, Jesu, regarde,
Et met cest alme in sauve garde.

‘And thereby hangeth a table, wherein appeareth that who so
ever prayeth for the soul of John Gower, he shall, so oft as he
so doth‚ have a thousand and five hundred days of pardon.’

Stow‚ writing about 1598, says, ‘ This church was again newly re-
built in the reign of Richard II and king Henry IV. John Gower,
a learned gentleman and a famous poet, but no knight‚ as some
have mistaken it, was then an especial benefactor to that work,
and was there buried in the north side of the said church, in the
chapel of St. John, where he founded a chantry. He lieth under
a tomb of stone with his image also of stone being over him.
The hair of his head brown, long to his shoulders but curling up,
collar of esses of gold about his neck 3 under his head,’ &c.³
The tomb is then further described as by Berthelette‚ with
addition of the epitaph in four Latin hexameters, ‘ Armigeri
scutum,' &c (see p. 367 of this volume).

In the Annals of England (date about 1600) he again describes
the tomb‚ adding to his description of the painting of the three
virgins the important note, ‘ All which is now washed out and the
image defaced by cutting off the nose and striking off the hands ⁴¹‚'

¹ Read rather ‘ En toy qu’es fitz de dieu le pere.'

² Read ‘ObonJesu‚ faita mercy’ and inthe second line ‘dontle corps gist cy.'

³ Survey ofLondon, p. 450 (ed. 1633). In the margin there is the note,
‘ John Gower no knight, neither had he any garland of ivy and roseS, but
a chaplet of four roses only,’ referring to Bale, who repeats Leland's
description.

⁴ p. 326 (ed. 1615). Stow does not say that the inscription ‘Armigeri
scutum,’ δια, was defaced in his time.
