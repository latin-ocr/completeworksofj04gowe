different stories, and it is difficult to say exaetly what he was thinking of.

277 f. Cp. Ovid, filetum. xi. 34ff.

280. crapulas. Ι (10 not know what this is, unless it is equivalent to
‘capulus‚’ which is rather doubtfully given by D. That would mean
the ‘handle' of the plough, but we have ‘ ansa' in 1. 282.

291. lllelczm. viii. 293.

in the margin, ‘ sete . a bristell.'

341. quod: consecutive, ‘ so that’3 cp. ‘ sic . . . quod‚' ll. 223, 311, ἃς.

405. The rubricator of the Digby MS. has written in the margin, ‘ i.e
threefoted dog commyng after halting.²

407. Digby MS. rubric, ‘i. e. Rig pe Teydog.' Note the position of
⁴ que,’ which should properly be attached to the first word of the line :
cp. l. 847.

455. As a note on ‘thalia' here (for ‘talia ⁷) the Digby MS. has
‘Thelea i. e. dea belli' written by the rubricator. It is difficult to

author as equivalent to the imperfect: cp. l. 541, iii. 705, 740, &c.
Also ‘solebat,’ i. 699, iii. 1485 ; cp. v. 333, where ‘solebant’ seems to

for the imperfect, e. g. l. 585 ‘ quas nuper abhorret Egiptus.’

499ff. See 1 Sam. v. The plague of mice is distinctly mentioned in
the Vulgate version, while in our translation from the Hebrew it is
implied in ch. vi. 5. ‘ Accharon’ is Ekron.
