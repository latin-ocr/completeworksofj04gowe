usually ‘sed.’

It has been thought better to print the elegiae couplet without
indentation for the pentameter, partly because that is the regular
usage in the MSS. and must of course have been the practice of
the author, but still more in order to mark more clearly the division
into paragraphs, to which the author evidently attached some import-
ance. Spaces of varying width are used to show the larger divisions.
It is impossible that there should not be some errors in the printed
text, but the editor can at least claim to have taken great pains to
ensure correctness, and all the proof-sheets have been carefully
compared with the text of the manuscripts.

For convenience of reference the lines are numbered as in the
Roxburghe edition, though perhaps it would be more satisfactory
to combine the prologues‚ as regards numbering, with the books
to which they belong.

In regard to the Notes there are no doubt many deficiencies.
The chief objects aimed at have been to explain difficulties of
language‚ to illustrate the matter or the style by reference to the
works of the author in F rench and in English, and to trace as far
as possible the origin of those parts of his work which are borrowed.
In addition to this, the historical record contained in the cronica
Trzpertita has been carefully compared with the evidence given by
others with regard to the events described, and possibly this part
of the editor's work, being based entirely upon the original
authorities, may be thought to have some small value as a

contribution to the history of a singularly perplexing political “

situation.
