The meaning is that the bad priests cry ⁶ Cras‚’ like crows, and en-
courage men to put off repentance, while the others sing ‘ Hodie,’ like
doves‚ the words ‘cras’ and ‘hodie’ being imitations of the notes of the
two birds. The expression ‘ Cras primam cantant‚' in l. 2039, is not
intelligible‚ and probably Gower missed the full sense of the passage.

34. ‘dompnus ² or ‘domnus ' was the form of ‘dominus ’ which was
properly applied as a title to ecclesiastical dignitaries, and it seems to
have been especially used in monasteries. Ducange quotes John of

claustralibus; sed Dominus, Domina mundanis) Cp. l. 323 of this
