lxvi GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

initials and other decorations throughout. The whole is written in one
hand, and there are no corrections or erasures such as might indicate
that the book had been in the hands of the author.

The manuscript seems to have been in the possession of the Sotheby
family since 1702, when it was ‘bought at Lord Burgley's sale for
A 1 25. od! No leaves are lost, but two are transposed at the end of
the fourth and beginning of the fifth books.

The text is very fairly correct, and the MS. is closely related to C both in text
and spelling (for which see i. Prol. 37 f., i. 21, 95, 447, 1706, 1776, 2017, ii.
174, 311 δία), but not derived from it (see i. 41, 1626, 2094, iii. 1760 ᾗ, ν.
785 ἱ). The passages which in C and the other original copies are rewritten

‘over erasure, as iii. 1 ff.‚ vi. 1161 ff, are usually given by E in the revised

form, but the marginal notes at iii. 375 and iv. 587 are omitted. Occasionally
too, where C has a correction, E gives the original reading in company with
H, as iii. 840, v. 785 f., and especially in the passages vi. 1219 ff. and vii.
182 ff„ where H no longer agrees with SCG in corrections, we find that E
goes with H. In the final poems E shows some independence as regards
marginal notes, e. g. in the last piece‚ where instead of ‘ Nota contra mortuo-
rum executores,' we find the much more pointed, though doubtfully gram-
matical, remark, ‘Nota quod bonum est vnicuique esse executor sui ipsius)
This is the only MS. except CHG which contains the short pieces at the end,
and the omission from these of ‘Presul, ouile regis' may be an indication that
the MS. was written before 1402.

As regards the picture in this MS„ the features of the archer are quite
different from those represented in the Cotton MS. He has a prominent
pointed nose and a light-coloured moustache and beard3 the arrow, held
between the sore-finger and the second and aimed upwards, covers the
mouth. The dress consists of a grey fur cap with a hood under it of light
crimson, covering also the upper part of the body z below this a blue surcoat
with brown lining and wide sleeves thrown back so as to leave the arms bare :
a red belt with buckle and pendant, and red hose. The globe is at a higher
level and smaller in proportion than in the other pictures. Like them
it is divided into three, the left hand upper division having a crescent

moon and four stars: a red cross with a banner stands at the summit of
the globe.

chapters. The name of a sixteenth-century owner, Roget Waller,
