lii GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

Take vengeance on wrong, and let justice be done without sear or
favour.

CAP. X. Show mercy also, where mercy is fitting, and listen to the
prayer of the poor and helpless. Let fit men of proper age and sufficient
wisdom be appointed to administer justice.

CAP. XI. Be not exalted with vain glory‚ Ο king, or moved by
sudden wrath to violence. Be liberal to those who need thy help, and
give alms to the poor of that which God has given' thee. Avoid
gluttony and sloth.

CAP. XII. Above all things, O king, fiee from the enticements of
fleshly lusts. Take example by the sin of David, and by that of the
Hebrews who were tempted by the counsel of Balaam. One consort
is sufficient for thee : be faithful to her.

CAP. XIII. O king, thou art the defender in arms of thy people.
Remember the deeds of thy father, whose praise is sounded everywhere
and whose prowess was above that of Hector. He was just and liberal ;
he made prey of foreign lands, but he protected his own. France and
Spain both felt his might, and he broke through the ranks of his enemies
like a lion. The land was at rest under that great prince: the nation
was secure from its enemies. O king, endeavour to deserve the
praise which thy father won. Peace is the best of all things, but it
must sometimes give way to war.

CAP. XIV. A king must not prey upon his people; their love is his
chief glory. He should remember that true nobility does not come from
noble descent but from virtue. Study to know thyself and to love God.

CAP. XV. O young king, remember how Solomon in his youth
asked for wisdom to rule well, rather than wealth or long life, and how
God granted his prayer and added also the other blessings. Wisdom
is above everything for a king, and this makes him acceptable to God.

CAP. XVI. Whatever thou hast, O king, comes from God. He has
given thee beauty of body, and thou must see to it that there be virtue
of the soul corresponding to this. Worship and fear God, for earthly
kingdoms are as nothing compared with his.

CAP. XVII. Death makes all equal; rich and poor, king and
subject, all go one way. Prepare thyself, therefore, sor thy journey,
and adorn thyself betimes with virtue. May God direct thee in the
right way.

CAP. XVIII. . 1The king is honoured above all, so long as his acts

¹ In the first version as follows, ‘O king of heaven, who didst create all
things, Ι pray thee preserve my young king, and let him live long and see
good days. O king, mayest thou ever hold thy sceptre with honour and
triumph, as Augustus did at Rome. May he who gave thee the power
confirm it to thee in the future.

For the glory os thy rule I have written these lines with humble heart.
Ο ssower of boyhood, according to thy worthiness I wish thee prosperity.'
