736. sepulta: used elsewhere by Gower for ‘funeral rites‚' e. g.
i. 1170. The meaning is that the friar claims to perform the funeral
services sor the dead bodies of those whose confessor he has been
before death. Perhaps however we should take ‘sepulta' here as
equivalent to ‘sepelienda' -

903. Cp. Ovid, [iselam. ii. 632, ‘Inter aves albas vetuit consistere

cum horninibus non flagellabuntur! The same passage is alluded to
in &Valsingharn’s chronicle (i. 324), where reference is made to the
