xxxii GOWER'S LATIN WORKS

this arrangement, apart from the fact that it occurs in a single
manuscript. The first book, with its detailed account of the
Peasants' revolt, though in itself the most interesting part of the
work, has certainly something of the character of an insertion.
The plan of the remainder seems to be independent of it, though
the date, June, 1381, which is found also in the Laud MS.‚
-‚‘C0ntigit vt quarto Ricardi regis in anno,
Dum clamat mensem Iunius esse suum,’

was doubtless intended to suggest that portentous event as
the occasion of the review of society which the work contains.
The prologue of the second book, which introduces the teachings
of the vision with an invocation of God's assistance, an apology
sor the deficiencies of the work, and an appeal to the goodwill
of the reader‚ and concludes with a first announcement of the
name of the succeeding poem, Vox mamantis, would certainly
be much more in place at the beginning of the whole work than
here, aster more than two thousand lines, and there is no
difficulty in supposing that the author may have introduced his
account of the Peasants' revolt as an afterthought. The chief
reason for hesitating to accept the Laud MS. as representing
an authentic form of the poem, lies in the fact that the textos this

MS. is rather closely related to that of another copy, MS. Digby
138, which contains the first book in its usual place 3 and it is per-

haps more likely that the original archetype of these two MSS. was
one which included the first book, and that this was omitted for
some reason by the scribe of the Laud MS.‚ than that the copyist
of the Digby MS. perceived the absence of this book and supplied
it from some other quarter.

One other matter affecting our estimate of the style of the com-
position generally has perhaps been sufficiently illustrated in the
Notes of this edition, that is to say, the extent to which the author
borrows in the Vox Clamantz‘s from other writers. It is sufficiently
obvious to a casual reader that he has appropriated a good many
lines from Ovid, though the extent of this schoolboy plagiarism is
hardly to be realised without careful examination 3 but his very
extensive obligations to other writers have not hitherto been
pointed out. He repeatedly takes not lines or couplets only, but
passages of eight, ten or even twenty lines from the Aurora of
Peter Riga, from the poem of Alexander N eckam De Vita
stsonaclzorum, from the Speculum Stztllorum, or from the Pantheon,
