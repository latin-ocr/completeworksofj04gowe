xxx GOWER‘S LATIN WORKS

from their tenour, that his chief aim in writing was edification‚
while at the same time we gather from the opening of the first
book of the Confessio Amanus that he then despaired of effecting
anything by direct admonition‚ and preferred finally to mingle
amusement with instruction. The Latin lines at the end of this
volume, beginning ‘Dicunt scripture,’ express a principle which
he seems to have followed himself, namely that a man should
give away money for good purposes during his own life, rather
than leave such business to be attended to by his executors.

The literary side of his activity is sufficiently dealt with in the
introductions to his several works, and there also it is noted what
were the books with which he was acquainted. It is enough to
say here that he was a man of fairly wide general reading, and
thoroughly familiar with certain particular books, especially the
Bible, all the works of Ovid, and the Aurora of Peter de Riga.

THE LATIN WORKS.

Of the works which are included in the present volume the
Vox Clamantis is the most important. It is written in elegiae
verse, more or less after the model of Ovid, and consists of
10‚265 lines, arranged in seven books, of which the first,
second and third have separate prologueS, and each is divided
into a series of chapters with prose headings. As to the date
of composition, all that we can say is that the work in its present
form is later than the Peasants’ rising in the summer of 1381,
and yet it was evidently composed while the memory of that
event was fresh, and also before the young king had grown
beyond boyhood. The advice to the king with regard to fidelity
in marriage need not be taken to have special reference to the
king's actual marriage at the end of the year 1382, but perhaps it
is more natural to suppose that it was written after that event
than before.

The general plan of the author is to describe the condition of
society and of the various degrees of men, much as in the latter
portion of the Speculum liffeditantis. This, however, is made
subordinate to the detailed account, given at the beginning, of the
Peasants’ rising, and that is in fact set down as the main subject
of the work in the Latin account of it given by the author:
