was fined two shillings for beating a Franciscan Friar in Fleet
Street. This is a hard collection to prove Gower of the Inner
Temple, although he studied the law, for thus you frame your argu-
ment: Mr. Buckley found a record in the Temple that Chaucer
was fined for beating the friar 3 ergo Gower and Chaucer were of
the Temple!

A ‘hard collection ⁷ it may be, but no harder than many others
that have been made by biographers, and Leland’s ‘vir equestris
ordinis ³ ' must certainly go the way of his other statements‚ being
sufficiently refuted, as Stow remarks, by the ‘Armiger' of Gower's
epitaph. Leland in calling him a knight was probably misled by
the gilt collar of SS upon his recumbent effigy, and Fuller after-
wards, on the strength of the same decoration, fancifully revives
the old theory that he was a judge, and is copied of course by
succeeding writers ². On the whole it may be doubted whether
there is anything but guesswork in the statements made by Leland
about our author, except so far as they are derived from his
writings or from his tomb.

That John Gower the poet was of a Kentish family is proved by
definite and positive evidence. The presumption raised by the
fact that his English writings certainly have some traces of the
Kentish dialect, is confirmed, first by the identity of the arms upon
his tomb with those of Sir Robert Gower, who had a tomb in
Brabourne Church in Kent‚ and with reference to whom Weever‚
writing in 1631, says, ‘From this family John Gower the poet was
descended ³‚' secondly‚ by the fact that in the year 1382 a manor
which we know to have been eventually in the possession of the
poet was granted to John Gower, who is expressly called ‘ Esquier
de Kent,' and thirdly‚ by the names of the executors of the poet⁷s
will, who are of Kentish families. It may be added that several
other persons of the name of Gower are mentioned in the records
of the time in connexion with the county of Kent. Referring
only to cases in which the Christian name also is the same as that
of the poet, we may note a John Gower among those complained
of by the Earl of Arundel in 1377, as having broken his closes at

³ Ancient Funeral Monuments, p. 27o.- This Sir Rob. Gower had property
in Suffolk, as we shall see, but the fact that his tomb was at Brabourne
shows that he resided in Kent. The arms which were upon his tomb are
pictured (without colours) in MS. Harl. 3917, f. 77.
