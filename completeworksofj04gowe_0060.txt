l GOWER‘S LATIN WORKS

CAP. XV. It is an ill bird that fouls its own nest, and it is shameful
for a citizen to benefit strangers at the expense of his fellow—citizens.
lt is an evil thing when one of low condition is exalted to the highest
place in the city. The evil man is a common scourge3 but though he
be mounted on high, he shall fall and perish.

CAP. XVI. The man whose tongue is unrestrained is as a pestilence
among the people. The tongue causes strife and many evils ; it breaks
through every guard and devours like a flame. None can say how
many evils the tongue of the talkative man brings about in the city:
it causes discord and hatred instead of peace and love 3 and where peace
and Iove are not, there God is not. The citizen who thus plagues-his
fellows should be put to death or banished: it is expedient that one
should die, lest the whole people should perish.

Thou ruler of the city, labour to bring about harmony and peace, and
above all deal prudently. Great consequences often follow from small
things, and the fire which seems to be extinguished may blaze up again.
Justice and peace, which formerly reigned, must be restored, so that
the ruin which overtook Rome and Athens may be averted from our city.

the cause of any man who pays him, and compels his rich neighbours
to give him gifts, for fear that evil should befall them. He has a thou-
sand ways of making his gains; the great and powerful break through
his snares, but the weak and defenceless are caught in them. Like the
bat or the ow] he loves darkness rather than light: yet sometimes the
biter is bitten.

CAP. II. The advocate oppresses and plunders the poor, and re-
joices in discord as a physician in disease. He contrives every device
to enrich himself and his offspring3 he joins house to house and field
to field. But his heir dissipates that which he has gathered together,
and a curse comes upon him at the last.

CAP. ΙΙΙ. The land is ruined by the excessive number of lawyers.
As a straight stick appears crooked when plunged in water, so does
straightforward and simple law become distorted in the mind of the
lawyer. As clouds conceal the sun, so do advocates obscure the clear
light of the law. Conspiracy, they say, is unlawful, but they them-
selves conspire to protect one another, and the law has no power over
these.

CAP. IV. They ascend by degrees from the rank of apprentice to
that of serjeant and soto the office of judge. The administration of
