shortly to recall the duke of Norfolk (p. 23). It is noteworthy that
Gower makes no mention whatever of the duke of N orfolk here.

128 (margin). It cannot of course be supposed that Henry embarked
at Calais. Probably he sailed from Boulogne. Froissart says that
his port of departure was Vannes in Brittany, but he expresses some
uncertainty about the matter, and his whole account here is hopelessly
inaccurate (xvii. 171, ed. Kervyn de Lettenhove).

137. nepote: that is Thomas, son of the late earl of Arundel; see
1. 130, mm'gz'n.

160 ff. The suggestion here that Richard foresaw the coming of
Henry and went to Ireland through sear of it, is of course absurd. At
the same time it is certain that he received warnings, and that in view
of these his expedition to Ireland was very ill—timed. The statement
in the margin, that he fatally wasted time in Ireland‚ is supported both
by the English annalists and by Creton. ln the Annales lese. ll we
read that a week was wasted by Richard’s hesitation as to the port
from which he should sail (p. 248), and Creton says that Richard was
delayed by the treacherous advice of the duke of Aumerle, who in-
duced him to leave the levying of troops in Wales to the earl of Salisbury
and to embark at his leisure at Watersord (Archaeologia, xx. 312).
Nothing is said of unfavourable winds in any ofthese authorities, except
that Creton observes that the news of Henry’s landing was delayed by
the bad weather (p. 309). Henry landed July 4, and Richard was in
XVales before the end of the month.

188. There is no authority for reading ‘sceleris’ in this line, as the
former editors have done. Presumably ⁴ sceleres ’ is for ‘celeres,' and
this form of spelling is found occasionally elsewhere in the MSS„ as
conversely ‘ceptrum' frequently sor ‘sceptrum.’ It is not easy to
translate the line, whatever reading we may adopt. It seems to
mean ‘So in their ignorance they hesitate,’ (‘few show themselves

- quick in action’).

205. mundum nec abhorruit istum, ‘nor renounced this world ’z
‘istum,' as usual, for ‘hunc.'

244. Augusti mensis. Richard left Flint on Aug. 19, and arrived in
London Sept. 2 (Annales Rsc. II, p. 251).

256. Huvffredum natum: that is Humphrey, the young son of the
duke of Gloucester. Richard had taken him to Ireland‚ and on hear-
ing of the landing of Henry had ordered him to be confined, together
with young Henry of Lancaster‚ in Trim castle (Walsingham, ii. 233).

272. transit moriens. He died apparently on the way back from
Ireland‚ in Anglesea according to Adam of Usk, who says that he was
poisoned (p. 28). Walsingham says that he died of‘pestilence’ (ii. 242):
cp. Annales Henrz'cz· IV, p. 321 (Rolls Series, 28. 3).

276. ngrmts : apparently the young duke of Gloucester is here meant,
and it is not intended to state that he was killed by grief sor the loss of
his father, but that his mother died of grief for him: cp. Annales
Hmrz‘cz· JV, p. 321.
