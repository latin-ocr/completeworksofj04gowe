396 vox CLAMANTIS

835 ff. It is difficult to say who'is the bad mayor of London to whom
allusion is here made. The rival leaders in City politics were Nicholas
Brembre and John of Northampton. The former was lord mayor in
the years 1377, 1378, and again in 1383 and 1384, when he was elected
against his rival (who had held the office in 1381, 1382) in a forcible and
unconstitutional manner which evoked many protests. Brembre‚ who
belonged to the Grocers' company, represented the interests of the
greater companies and was of the Court party, aspecial favourite with the
king, while John of N orthampton‚ a draper, engaged himself in bitter con-
troversy with the Fishmongers‚ who were supported by the Grocers, and
was popular with the poorer classes. In the Crom‘ca T rz'pertz'ta Gower
bitterly attacks Brembre (who was executed by sentence of the so-ealled
‘ Merciless Parliament’ in 1388), and we might naturally suppose that he
was the person referred to here 3 but that passage was written before the
political events which led to that invective and in all probability not
later than 1382, and the references to the low origin of the mayor in
question, ll. 84 5-860, do not agree with the circumstances of N ieholas
Brembre. Political passion in the City ran high from the year 1376
onwards‚ and the person referred to may have been either John of
N orthampton or one of the other mayors, who had in some way
incurred Gower’s dislike: cp. Μίνωιν, 26365 ff.

877. Cp. Cons. Amanlz's, v. 7626,

‘It floureth, bot it schal not greine
Unto the fruit of rihtwisnesse.'

915f. Ovid, Tristia, i. 5. 47 f.
922. Cp. Prov. xxv, 15, ‘lingua mollis confringet duritiam‚' and the
verses at the beginning of the Confessio A mantis,
‘Ossibus ergo carens que conterit ossa loquelis
Absit.²
953 f. Ars Amat. ii. 183 f.‚ but Ovid has ‘Numidasque leones.

967 f. Cp. Rem. Amoris, 97 s.
969 f. Cp. Rem. Amoris, 101 f.
