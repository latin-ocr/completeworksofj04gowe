opponents. Gower expresses the state of things pretty accurately‚ when
he says below z

‘R. proceres odit et eorum predia rodit,

H. fouet, heredesque suas restaurat in edes;
R-. regnum vastat vindex et in omnibus astat,
Mulset terrorem pius H„ que reducit amorem.⁷

REX CELI ETC. (p. 343)

This piece is here connected by its heading with the Cronz'ca
Tm‘perlila, but it occurs also in the Glasgow MS. independently and
in the Trentham MS. as a sequel to the poem In Praise ofPeace, with
the following in place of the present heading, ‘ Explicit carmen de pacis
commendacione . . . Et nunc sequitur epistola, in qua idern Iohannes
pro statu et salute dicti domini sui apud altissimum deuocius exorat.'
The poem itself is an adaptation of the original version of VoxClamantis‚
vi. cap. 18 : see vol. iii. p. 554.

H. AQUILE PULLUS ETc. (p. 344)

The word ‘ Prophecia’ in the margin seems to be intended to recall
the supposed prophecy of Merlin about the ‘ filius (or pullus) aquilae '
(Archaeol. xx. p. 257, Adam of Usk's Chronicle‚ p. 133).

These four lines immediately follow the c‘ronica Tmperlita in the
Glasgow and Hatton MSS„ and are themselves followed by two quo·
tations from the Psalms (lxxxviii. 23, xl. 3) ε

‘Nichil proficiet inimicus in eo, et filius iniquitatis non apponet
nocere ei.’

‘Dominus conseruet eum, et viuificet eum, et beatum faciat eum
in terra, et non tradat eum in animam inimicorum eius.’

ln the Trentham MS. we have the lines ‘ H. aquile pullus‚’ and the
above quotations‚ subjoined to the first eight lines of ‘ O recolende‚’
as part of the dedication of the Cz‘nkanfe Balades: see vol. i. p. 336.

1. aquile pullus: Henry is called so because his father was named
John and used the eagle as one of his cognisances : cp. Adam of Usk,
p. 24, ‘ pullus aquile, quia filius Iohannis.7 The reference is to a
prophecy, one form of which is quoted by the editor of Adam of Usk’s
Chronicle‚ p. 133. For the use of the eagle by John of Gaunt see
Sandford's Genealoglcal Hz'slmy, p. 249.

2. colla. The reading of S may be supported by reference to Vox
Clamanlz's, vi. 876, where our author in borrowing from the Aurora
substitutes ‘bella ’ for ‘ corda ' or ‘ colla.’

3. aquile . . . oleum: this is the oil produced for Henry‘s coronation,
which was said to have been miraculously delivered to Thomas a Becket
in a vial enclosed within an eagle of gold, and deposited by him in the
