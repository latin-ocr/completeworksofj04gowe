lxxii GOWER'S LATIN WORKS

‘Dicunt scripture’ were printed by Karl Meyer in his dissertation
Jolm Gower’s Bezzelmngen zu Chaucer &a pp. 67, 68.

Of Coxe’s edition I wish to speak with all due respect. It has
served a very useful purpose, and it was perhaps on a level with the
critical requirements of the time when it was published. At the
same time it cannot be regarded as satisfactory. The editor tells us
that his text is that of the All Souls MS. ‘ collated throughout word
for word with a MS. preserved among the Digby MSS. in the
Bodleian, and here and there with the Cotton MS. [Tib. A. iv.]
sufficiently to show the superiority of the All Souls MS! The
inferior and late Digby MS. was thus uncritically placed on a level
with those of first authority, and even preferred to the Cotton MS.
It would require a great deal of very careful collation to convince
an editor that the text of the All Souls MS. is superior in correct-
ness to that of the Cotton MS„ and it is doubtful whether after
all he would come to any such conclusion. As regards correctness
they stand in fact very nearly on the same level: each might set
the other right in a few trifling points. It is not, however, from the
Cotton MS. that the Roxburghe editor takes his corrections, when
he thinks that any are needed. In such cases he silently adopts
readings from the Digby MS„ and in a much larger number of
instances he gives the text of the All Souls MS. incorrectly, from
insufficient care in copying or correcting. The most serious results
of the undue appreciation of the Digby MS. are seen in those
passages where S is defective, as in the Prologue of the first book,
and in the well-known passage i. 783 ff.‚ where the text of D is
taken as the sole authority, and accordingly errors abound, which
might have been avoided by reference to C or any other good copy¹.
The editor seems not to have been acquainted with the Harleian
MS., and he makes no mention even of the second copy of the
Vox clamantis which he had in his own library, MS. Laud 719.

The same uncritical spirit which we have noted in this editor's
choice of manuscripts for collation appears also in his manner of
dealing with the revised passages. When he prints variations, it
is only because he happens to find thern in the Digby MS., and
he makes only one definite statement about the differences of

¹ 1t is even the case in one instance (i. 846) that a blank is left in the line
for a word omitted in D which might have been supplied by reference to any
other MS. which contained the passage. So difficult was communication
between Oxford and London in those days.
