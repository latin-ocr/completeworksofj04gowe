414 CRONICA TRIPERTITA

286. dies lllartls, Tuesday‚ Sept. 30. Richard’s renunciation was
made on Sept. 29 (Rot. Parl. iii. 416 ff.).

300 ff. The demise of the crown made new writs necessary, but the
same parliament met again six days later (Oct. 6).

310. verbalis . . . non iudicialis. This appears to mean that the
proceedings were confined to a recital of the circumstances connected
with the deposition of Richard, and that no parliamentary business was
done until after the coronation, which took place on the next Monday,
Oct. 13.

332ff. The threefold right is stated here by Gower in the same
way as by Chaucer:

‘O conquerour of Brutes Albioun‚
Which that by lyne and free eleccioun
Ben verray kyng,’ ἃς.

In the margin, however, Gower places the right by conquest last, and
tempers the idea of it by the addition ⁶ sine sanguinis effusione.’
Henry’s challenge claimed the realm by descent through ‘right line of
blood’ (that is, apparently, setting aside descent through females,
cp. Ezclog. Hist. contin. iii. 383) and by ‘that right which God of
his grace hath sent me . . . to recover it’ (that is, by conquest).
To these was added the right conferred by parliamentary election.
It is not at all necessary to suppose that he relied on the legend
about Edmund Crouchback, which had been officially examined and
rejected (Adam of Usk, p. 30). His reference to Henry III rnay have
been occasioned only by the fact that he was himself of the same name,
and would come to the throne as Henry IV.

324. That is Oct. 13, the Translation of Edward the Confessor.

341. augit. This form is given by all the MSS.

352 ff. Rot. Parl. iii. 426.

364 ff. leat. Parl. iii. 425.

368 ff. leot. Parl. iii. 43off.

378 ff. Ros. Pczrl. iii. 449 ff.

384 ff. This refers to the fact that the dukes of Aumerle, Surrey, and
Exeter, the marquis of Dorset, and the earl of Gloucester, were con·
demned to lose the titles of duke, marquis, and earl respectively. The
case of the earl of Salisbury was reserved for future decision by
combat with lord de Morley.

388 f. This seems clearly to imply that Bagot was eventually
pardoned, and this conclusion is confirmed by leot. Parl. iii. 458 (over-
looked by the author of Bagot's life in the Dz‘ct. cffNatsonal Bz'qgrrczplzy),
where there is record of a petition presented by the Commons for the
restoration ofhis lands (Feb. 1401), which seems to have been granted
by the king.

394 ff. This is confirmed by Walsingham, ii. 242, and Annales
Henrz'cz' l V, p. 320.

402 f. Holland and Kent are the former dukes of Exeter and Surrey,
