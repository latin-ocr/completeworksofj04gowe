89-94. From Aurora, (MS. Bodley 822) f. 66, where however the
reading is ‘sapit’ in 1. 94 <for ‘ rapit ').

95-98. Aurora‚f. 65, where we find ‘in nocte’ for ‘in noctem ' and
‘reprobi' for ‘legis ’ (l. 97).

101 f. Cp. Aurora, 64 f..

‘Inprouisus adest cum pullos tollere miluus
Esurit, in predam non sine fraude ruit!

This is adapted by our author to his own purpose, but as his meaning
is altogether different, some obscurity results, and he does not make it
clear to us how the biter is bit.

113. Metam. v. 606.

115-118. Cp. stsetam. vi. 527 ff.

133. In the Glasgow MS. ‘locuplex’ has been altered to the more
familiar ‘ locuples!

141 f. Is. v. 8, ‘Vae qui coniungitis domum ad domum et agrum
agro copulatis usque ad terminum loci: numquid habitabitis vos soli in
medio terrae ? ’ The same text is quoted in the Mirour, 24541 ff.

144. By comparison with Mz‘rour, 24580 ff. we may see that the

233 f. ‘And this lex, legis, from ledo, ledis, as ius from z'urg0‚
administers justice at this present time! It is meant that the ad-
ministration of laW‚ as we see it, suggests the above etymologies.
The use of ‘isto’ for ‘hoc' is quite regular.
