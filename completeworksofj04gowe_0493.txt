⁶ Ollarum carnes, peponum fercula, porros,
Cepas pro manna turba gulosa petit.

Quosdam consimiles sinus ecclesie modo nutrit,
Qui pro diuinis terrea uana petunt.

Carnes ollarum carnalia facta figurant
Que uelut in nostra carne libido coquit!

It would seem that Gower read ‘Gebas’ (which has no meaning)
for ‘ Cepas ' and ‘ preponunt,' as in MS. Univ. Coll. 143, for ‘ peponum‚'
which is the true reading, meaning ‘ melons ' or ‘ pumpkins.’

115. Cp. Metam. xv. 173.

Cap. iii. Headz'ng. Cp. Conf. Α mantis, Prol. 288 (margin), where this
is given as a quotation from Gregory.

141 f. Cp. Μίνοιιν de l’Omme, 18553.

167 f. From Aurora, f. 37.

175. gregis ex pietate monetur, ‘ is moved by pity for his flock.’

193 ff. With this passage compare Cons. A mantis, Prol. 407-413, and
Mz‘rour de l’Omme, 20161 ff. In all these places a distinct charge is
brought against the clergy, to the effect that they encourage vice, in
order to profit by it themselves in money and in influence: ‘the
prostitute is more profitable to them than the nun,’ as our author
significantly says in the Mz‘rozcr (20149).

209 ff. Cp. Mz‘rour de l’Omme, 20113 ff.

227 ff. For this attack on the ‘positive law' of the Church cp. Cous.
Amantis, Prol. 247, Mz'rom, 18469 ff. The ‘ lex positiva ’ is 'that which
is enjoined not as of inherent moral obligation‚ but as imposed by
Church discipline.

249 f. Cp. Mirour, 18997 ff. Apparently ‘nouo’ is an adverb,
meaning ‘ anew,’ ‘ again ‘ ε cp. 284, 376.

265 ff. Cp. Mirour, 18505 ff.

283 ff. Cp. Mirour, 18637, Cous. Amantis, ii. 3486.

329 ff. With this chapter compare Mirour, 18649—18732.

375. The note which we find here in the margin of SCHGD refers
to the crusade of the bishop of Norwich in Flanders in the year 1383,
which probably took place soon after the completion of our author’s
book. It is added in SCHG in what appears to be one and the same
hand, possibly that of the author himself. If we may judge by the
manner in which the campaign in question is referred to by con-
temporary chroniclers‚ it seems to have been considered a public
scandal by many others besides Gower.

419. Gower uses ‘sublimo’ as an ablat. sing. in l. 701; therefore
‘ sublimis' may here be an ablative plural agreeing with ‘meritis'
