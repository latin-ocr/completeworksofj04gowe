xliv GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

staff is turned into a spear and the mitre into a helmet, we can slay
with sword as well as with word, and whereas Peter cut off the ears,
we cut off the head!

CAP. XI. These claim the worship and honour which belong to
God alone, and the goods which they unjustly seize are never restored.
The shepherd preys like a wolf upon his own sheep.

CAP. XII. He who is promoted to dignity in the Church by simony
is like the thies who enters not by the door into the sheepfold. The
Church is a congregation of faithful men, and the clergy are no better
than the laity, except so far as they lead better lives. Yet they lay
burdens upon us which they will not bear themselves, and do not follow
their own precepts. They bear the keys of heaven, but they neither
enter themselves nor allow us to enter: they set no good example to
their flocks.

CAP. XIII. A prelate should be a light to guide his people by
example, and he should encourage them by his voice, and also
reprove and restrain. The oil with which he is anointed is a type of
the qualities that he ought to display.

CAP. XIV. At the Court of Rome nothing can be done without
gifts: the poor man is everywhere rejected. The spirit of Antichrist

CAP. XVII. Another gets leave from the bishop to leave his parish
on the plea of study at the universities ; but there he learns and teaches
only Iessons of unchastity. The Church, which is his true bride, is
neglected‚ and harlots receive the tithe which belongs to God.

CAP. XVIII. A third rector resides in his parish, but spends his
time in sports, keeps well—fed horses and dogs, while the poor are not
relieved or the sick visited, makes his voice heard more in the fields
and woods than in the church. He lays snares too for the women of
his parish, and if their bodies be fair, he cares not how their souls are
defiled.

CAP. XIX. Another neglects his cure of souls and makes money by
buying and selling. He is liberal of his wealth to none but women;
and if benefices were inherited by the children of those who hold them,
the succession would seldom fail.

CAP. XX. The priests without benefices‚ who get their living by
‘ annuals,' are equally bad: the harlot and the tavern consume their
