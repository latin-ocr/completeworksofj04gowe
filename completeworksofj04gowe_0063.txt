are good, but if the king be avaricious and proud, the people is grieved.
Not all that a king desires is expedient sor him: he has a charge laid
upon him and must maintain law and do justice.

O king, do away the evils of thy reign, restore the laws and banish
crime : let thy people be subject to thee for love and not sor fear.

CAP. XIX. All things change and die, the gerns that were bright
are now dimmed‚ the Church herself has lost her virtue, and the
Synagogue becomes the spouse of Christ. The good men of old have
passed away, and the bad of old live again. Noah, Japhet, Abraham,
Isaac, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Elijah, Micaiah, Elisha are gone3 Nimrod,
Ham, Belus, Ishrnael, Abiram, Korah, Dathan, Zedekiah, and Gehazi
survive. Peter is dead, but Tiberius lives; Paul is reconverted into
Saul; the examples of Gregory, Martin‚ Tobit‚ and Job are neglected.
Benedict is dead, but Julian lives : there is a new Arius, a new Jovinian,
who spread their heresy.

CAP. XX. As the good men in the Church of God have passed
away, so also the men who were farned for prowess in the world are gone,
as Trajan,Justinian, Alexander, Constantine, Theodosius,Julius, Hanni-

David and Jonathan is gone, but the hatred of Saul still lives; the
counsel of Achitophel is followed and that of Hushai rejected; Cato is
banished and Pilate is made judge in his stead3 Mordecai is hanged

CAP. XXI. Temperance and chastity also have disappeared.
Socrates and Diogenes are dead, Epicurus and Aristippus still live;
Phirinus is dead and Agladius survives; Troilus and Medea are dead,
while Jason and Criseida remain 3 Penelope and Lucretia have passed
away, Circe ancl Calipso still live. The laws of marriage are no
longer kept in these days, chaste love is all but unknown, and adultery
everywhere prevails. Women have no modesty‚ no chastity, and
no patience: vice blooms and flourishes, while the fiower of virtue is
trodden under foot.

LIBER SEPTIMUS.

CAP. Ι. Now the golden head of N ebuchadnezzar's statue is gone,
and the feet of iron and clay remain : the world is in its final stage of
deterioration. There are principally two causes, lechery, which leads
to sloth, and avarice, which is ever unsatisfied.

‘CAP. II. The avaricious are merciless to the poor, and their hard
hearts are typified by the iron of the statue. He is wretched who is
ever desiring more, not he who has little and is content.

CAP. 111. The fragile clay signifies the frailty of our flesh, which
shows itself in fornication and adultery. There is also hypocrisy every-
