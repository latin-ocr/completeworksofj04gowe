402 VOX CLAMANTIS

1330. Vix si: cp. iv, 218, Cron. Trip. iii. 444.

1345. Cp. Ovid, Amores, i. 9. 1.

1357 f. ‘ She is silent as a jackdaw‚ chaste as a pigeon, and gentle as
a tighrlni. Perhaps an allusion to the case of Edward III and Alice
Perrers.

LIB. VII.

5. Cp. Confi Amantz's, Prol. 595 ff.
9. modo, ‘now ’: cp. note on vi. 1204.
12. nec . . . vix. For this combination of ‘vix ’ with a negative cp.
v. 104, 153.
42. dicunt . . . volunt, ‘say that they wish ’ z cp. ii. 200 f.
47 f. Cp. Cotgf. Amasztis, v, 49 ff. ; so below, 11. 61 ff.
123. Rev. ii. 25, ‘id quod habetis tenete, donec veniam.’
125 f. Ovid, Tristia, i. 8. 41 f.,
‘Et tua sunt silicis circum praecordia venae,
Et rigidum ferri semina pectus habet?

159f. It is difficult to construe this couplet satisfactorily, and the
reading ‘Est’ seems quite as good as ‘Et.’ The Glasgow MS. has
‘ Et status ’ erased, as if for correction.

163 ff. Cp. zllz'rour, 8921 ff.

167. The original reading seems to have been ‘grassantur‚' for
which S gives ‘ grossantur ' (‘ o ’ written over erasure), and CG
‘ crassantur‚’ also by correction.

182ff. I have no record of the readings of H2 in this passage, but
Ι have no doubt that it agrees with EHT.

184. No record of the reading of T.

186. abhorret: apparently subjunctive3 so we have ‘adhero‘ sor
‘adhereo‚’ 1. 1296.

192. habere modum : a first-hand correction in S, whereas the others
in ll. 182—192 are in a different hand.

194. caput ancille : an allusion to the form in which Satan is supposed
to have appeared in the garden of Eden.

243. specialis, subst., ‘ a friend.’

255 f. Cp. Ovid, Ars Amat. ii. 201 f.,

‘Riserit‚ adride3 si flebit, flere memento:
Imponat leges vultibus illa tuis!

In adapting the couplet to his purpose our author has contrived to
make it unintelligible.

265. Fuluus . . . talus: referring to the gilded spur of knighthood ;
gold is ‘ metallum fuluum.’

273 f. Cp. Tristia, v, 13. 27 f.

315 f. Cp. Metam. i. 144 f.

323 f. Cp. Ars Amal. i. 761 f.

327 f. Fasti, iv. 717 f. The application belongs to our author.
