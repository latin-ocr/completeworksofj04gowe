It will be seen that most of the above variants are due to mere oversight.
It is surprising, however, that so many mistakes seriously affecting sense and
metre should have escaped the correction of the editor.

In the matter of spelling the variationis considerable, but all that
need be said is that the Roxburghe editor preferred the Classical to the
medieval forms. On the other hand it is to be regretted that no attempt
is made by him to mark the paragraph divisions of the original. A
minor inconvenience, which is felt by all readers who have to refer to
the Roxburghe text, arises from the fact that the book-nurnbering is
not set at the head of the page.

In the case of the Crom'ca Trzpertita we have the text printed by
Wright in the Rolls Series as well as that of the Roxburghe edi-
tion. The latter is from the All Souls MS„ while the former
professes to be based upon the Cotton MS„ so that the two texts
ought to be quite independent. As a matter of fact, however,
several of the mistakes or misprints of the Roxburghe text are
reproduced in the Rolls edition, which was printed probably from
a copy of the Roxburghe text collated with the Cotton MS.

The following are the variations of the Roxburghe text from that of
the present edition.
