that is, 176 leaves of original text, preceded by two blanks‚ on the
second of which is Sir Robert Cotton’s Table of Contents, ending ‘ Liber
vt videtur ipsius autoris‚' the first leaf of the text being now numbered
f. 2. In quires of eight with catchwords, signed a, b, c, ἃς. from
f. 10 (where the text of the Vox Clamamz's begins) the first quire,
containing the chapter—headings &c., written in a hand different from
that of the main part of the text. Leaves measure about 10><6{ in.
Written in single column, 38 lines to the page in the Vox Clamantis, 40
or more in the Cronica T riperlz'la. The MS. has been carefully cor-
rected, and revised passages appear written over erasure as in SGH.
Capitals coloured and gilded at the beginning of the books, coloured
blue and red at the beginning of Chapters and paragraphs. On f. 9,
the last of the first quire, a picture like that in the Glasgow MS.‚ of the
author shooting at the world, as shown in the frontispiece of this volume.

On f. 2 is written ‘ Roberti Cotton liber ex dono doctissimi Patricii
Youngi generosi.' The book suffered sornewhat in the fire of 1731,
but it has been carefully and skilfully repaired, and though the writing
at the top of each page shows traces of the heat, no part of it is
illegible. The effect produced is clearly visible on the page of which
a faesimile is given. “

The text os C is a very good one and unquestionably independent. In
regard to spelling it may be observed that the copyist of the Vox Clamanti's
frequently gives ‘u' for ‘v’ at the beginning of words, he writes ‘sed'
almost always for ‘ sets and⁴ often ‘ti ' sor ‘ci’ in words like ‘ etiam,' ‘ ratio‚'
‘ patiens ' and even ‘ satie ’ (ii. 57), but also ‘ eciam‚' ‘ ambicio,’ ⁴ precium‚' δίο.

The following are the hands, so sar as they can be distinguished:

(1) Text of the Vox Clamantis, a small and sornewhat irregular but clear
hand, os the fourteenth century.
