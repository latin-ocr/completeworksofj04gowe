viii INTRODUCTION

6 Ric. II on a matter which had been already mentioned by
Nicolas on the authority of Mr. Petrie. As the result of a further
examination of the Close Rolls and other records Ι am able to
place some of the transactions referred to in a clearer light, while
at the same time I find myself obliged to cast serious doubt on
the theory that all the documents in question relate to the poet.
In short, the conclusions at which I arrive, so far as regards the
records, are mostly of a negative character.

It may be taken as proved that the family to which John Gower
the poet belonged was of Kent. Caxton indeed says of him that
he was born in W ales, but this remark was probably suggested by
the name of the ‘land of Gower ' in Wales, and is as little to be
trusted as the further statement that his birth was in the reign of
Richard II. There was a natural tendency in the sixteenth century
to connect him with the well-known Gowers of Stitenham in
Yorkshire, whence the present noble family of Gower derives its
origin, and Leland says definitely that the poet was of Stitenham¹.
It is probable‚ however, that Leland had no very certain informa-
tion 3 for when we examine his autograph manuscript, we find
that he first wrote, following Caxton, ‘ ex Cambria, ut ego accepi,
originem duxit,' and afterwards altered this to ‘ex Stitenhamo,
villa Eboracensis prouinciae, originem ducens.' It is probable
that the credit of connexion with the poet had been claimed by
the Yorkshire family, whose ‘ proud tradition,' as Todd says, ‘ has
been and still is that he was of Stitenham,' and we find reason to
think that they had identified him with a certain distinguished
lawyer of their house. This family tradition appears in Leland's
Itinerarium, vi. 13, ‘The house of Gower the poete sumtyme
chief iuge of the commune place' (i.e. Common Pleas) ‘yet
remaineth at Stitenham yn Yorkshire, and diuerse of them syns
have been knights.’ He adds that there are Gowers also in
Richmondshire and worcestershire (‘Wicestreshire,' MS). The
statement that this supposed judge was identical with the poet
is afterwards withdrawn 3 for on a later page Leland inserts
a note, ‘Mn Ferrares told me that Gower the iuge could not
be the man that write the booke yn Englisch, for he said that
Gower the iuge was about Edward the secundes tyme.' ²

² ltin. vi. 55. From Foss, Tabulae Curiaks, it would seem that there was
no judge named Gower in the 14th century.
