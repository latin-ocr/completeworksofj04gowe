xii INTRODUCTION

Under date Feb. 15 of the same year it was reported that
this would not be to the prejudice of the king, and accordingly on
March 9 John Gower pays 53 shillings, which appears to be the
annual value of the property, and is pardoned for the offence
committed by acquiring it without licence ¹.

39 Ed. III (June 23). William Sepvanus, son of William Sepvanus
knight‚ grants to John Gower ten pounds rent from the manor of
Wygebergh <Wigborough) in Essex and from other lands held by
him in the county of Essex ².

By another deed, acknowledged in Chancery on June 25 of
the same year, the same William Sepvanus makes over to John
Gower all his claims upon the manor of Aldyngton, and also
a rent of 145. (δαί, with one cock, thirteen hens and 140 eggs from
Maplecomb ³.

42 Ed. III (1368). Thomas Syward‚ pewterer and citizen of
London, and Joanna his wife, daughter of Sir Robert Gower,
grant to John Gower and his heirs the manor of Kentwell. Dated
at Melford‚ W ednesday before the Nativity of St. John Baptist ⁶¹.

43 Ed. III. Fine between John Gower on the one hand, and
John Spenythorn with Joan his wife on the other, by which they
give up all right to the Manor of Kentwell‚ Suffolk, except ,ξ 10
rent, John Gower paying 200 marks ⁵.

This was confirmed in the king’s court, 3 Ric. II.

By documents of previous date6 it may be shown that the
manor of Kentwell had been held by Sir Rob. Gower, doubtless
the same who is buried in Brabourne Church, who died apparently
in 1349 3 that it was ultimately divided, with other property,
between his heirs, two daughters named Katherine and Joanna,
of whom one, Katherine‚ died in 1366. Her moiety was then
combined with the other in the possession of her sister Joanna,
⁴ 23 years old and upwards,' then married to William Neve of
Wetyng, but apparently soon afterwards to Thomas Syward. As

that ‘John Gower died seized of half the manor of Aldyngton‚ 39 Ed. 111,' or
‘John Gower died seized of the manor os Kentwell, 42 Ed. 111)
