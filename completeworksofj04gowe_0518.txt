408 CRONICA TRIPERTITA

158 f. Though he was a knight, he was not dignified with the nobler
form of execution, being a citizen of London.

162. Cormtbiensis: Sir Robert Tresilian‚ Chief Justice.

172. salsa szgilla : that is, the seals set by the judges to the questions
and replies submitted to them at Nottingham. ‘In quorum omnium
testimonium lusticiarii et Serviens predicti sigilla sua presentibus
apposuerunt’ (leot. Parl. iii. 2333 cp. Knighton, ii. 237). They all
pleaded that they had set their seals to these replies under the influence
of threats from the archbishop of York‚ the duke of Ireland‚ and the
earl of Suffolk.

173. magis ansam, ‘ or rather a handle ’ (i. e. a pretext). The reading
of the MSS. is doubtful (S apparently ‘ausam,’ but with a stop after
⁶ regi '). The form of expression is not unusual with our author.

174 f. ‘There was no punishment which would have been sufficient‚'&c.

176. ficta pietate: that is, what our author in the Corgf. A mantis calls
‘ pite seigned,’ i. e. false or misplaced clemency.

176ff. Knighton says that the queen interceded for them with the
prelates (ii. 295). For the intervention of the prelates see Rot. Parl,
111. 241.

178 f. For the terms of their exile see Rot. Parl. iii. 244, Knight0n‚
ii. 295f.

183. The sense of the preceding negative seems to be extended to
this line also.

188ff. Ι do not know of any other authority for this expulsion of
friars.

200. cantus: apparently genitive in spite of the metre3 so ‘ ducatus,²
iii. 117, ‘excercitus‚' ‘luxus‚’ Vox clamantis, i. 609, vi. 1224.
215. hirundo : a reference to the name Arundel.

SECUNDA PARS

There is an interval of nearly ten years between the first and the
second part of the Chronicle. Our author proceeds to the events of
1397. He assumes that the king carried out a long-meditated plan of
vengeance, cp. ll. 23 ff„ but this was of course an after-thought by way
of accounting for what happened.

15. A pardon was granted to all three in the Parliament of 1387-88,
‘par estatut’ (see Rot. Parl. iii. 350), and a special charter of pardon
was granted to the earl of Arundel at Windsor‚ April 30, 1394 (Rot. Parl.
iii. 351 ; cp. Ann. Rz'c. II, p. 211). See below, ll. 259 f., where the charters
of pardon are said to have been procured by archbishop Arundel who
was then Chancellor. It seems to be implied that the other two had
similar charters‚ but nothing is said of this in the Rolls of Parliament;
cp. Eulog. Hz'st. iii. 374. ·

56. Cp. Ann. Rz'c. Il, p. 202 (Rolls Series, 28. 3) ‘iurans suo solito
iuramento, per sanctum Iohannem Baptistam, quod nihil mali pateretur
in corpore, si se pacifice reddere voluisset!
