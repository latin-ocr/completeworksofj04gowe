church of St. Gregory at Poitiers. 1t was said to have been brought
to England by Henry, first duke of Lancaster, and to have been de-
livered by him to the Black Prince. Thus it came into the possession
of Richard II, who is said to have worn it constantly about his neck.
He had desired to be re-anointed with this oil, but archbishop
Arundel had refused to perform the ceremony (Annales Henrscz· l V,
pp. 297-300, Eulog. Hz‘st. contin. iii. 380).

o RECOLENDE, ETc. (p·345)

The first eight lines of this appear in the Trentham MS. in combina-
tion with ‘ H. aquile pullus ’ as part of the dedication of the Csnlesznte
Balades.

16 ff. For ‘ pietas‚' ⁶ pius,’ see note on Crom'ca Trzssertita, iii. 462.

CARMEN SUPER MULTIPMCI VICIORUM PESTILENCIA
(p· 346)

‘ Putruerunt et corrupte sunt‚’ ἃς. This is in fact a quotation from
the Psalmis, ‘Putruerunt et corruptae sunt cicatrices meae a facie
insipientiae meae‚' xxxvii. 6. (xxxviii. 5).

32. quasi louinianz'. Already in the Vox Clamanlis we have had
reference to the ‘new Jovinian’ who is a sower of heresy (vi. 1267),
and the person meant is no doubt Wycliffe. Jovinian‚ the opponent of

'Jerome on the marriage question, is taken as a type of the ecclesiastic

of lax principles. Milman calls Jovinian and Vigilantius ‘premature
Protestants' (Hz'story osClzrz'stiaszily, Bk, III. ch. iv).

36. sub grossa lana: an allusion perhaps to the simple russet garb of
XVycliffe’s poor priests.

52 ff. Cp. Vox Clamcmlis, ii. 437 ff„ whence many of these lines are
taken, e.g. 54—57, 60—77.

54. mortis ymago : that is, the mortal creature.

86. ‘time' was probably written originally for‘stude' in SCH, as
well as in F, but it was perceived perhaps that ‘ reuereri,‘ which was
required for the rhyme, would not stand as an imperative. Similarly
in line 88 ‘ Que fantasias aliter tibi dant' stood no doubt originally in
SCH, and was altered for grammatical reasons.

181f. This couplet is repeated from Vox Clamantis, vi. 861 f.

190. qnczmprz'us, for ‘ prius quam‚’ as frequently: cp. 11. 202, 292.

199. This line is from Ovid‚ lllelczm. vii. 826, ‘ Credula res amor est,'
δία, and is quite without sense as it stands here ε cp. Vox Clmnczlzlis,
v. 165.

203 f. 1 Cor. vi. 18.

246 ff. Cp. Vox Clamantl's, vi. 445 ff.

250. semel nisi, i. e. ‘once only ’ for ‘ non nisi semel ' ; cp. Vox
Clammztis, iii. 22. ’
