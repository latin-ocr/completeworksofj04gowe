VOX CLAMANTIS. ANALYSIS xlvii

perform duties that are irksome. The prior should be gentle with his
younger brethren and not make the yoke too heavy for them.

CAP. XIII„ As regards nuns, they too are under the rule of chastity 3
but as women are more frail by nature than men, they must not be so
severely punished if they break it. They require meat often on Fridays
sor their stomachs’ sake, and this is prepared for them by Genius the
priest of Venus.

CAP. XIV. Where Genius is the confessor ofa convent, the laws
of the flesh prevail. The priest who visits nuns too often corrupts
them, and the woman very easily yields to temptation. A wife may
deceive her husband, but the bride of Christ cannot conceal her
unfaithfulness from him : therefore she above all others should be chaste.

CAP. XV. True virginity is above all praise‚ and this surpasses every
other condition, as a rose surpasses the thorns from which it springs.
The best kind of virginity is that which is vowed to God.

CAP. XVI. Not all whom Christ chose were faithful, and every-
where bad and good are minglecl together; but the fault of the bad is
not a reason for condemning the good. So when I speak of the evil
deeds of Friars, 1 condemn the bad only and absolve the good.

The number of mendicant friars is too great and their primitive rule
has been forgotten. They pretend to be poor, but in fact they possess
all things, and have power over the pope himself. Both life and death
bring in gains to them.

CAP. XVII. They preach hypocritically against sin in public, but in
private they encourage it by flattery and indulgence. They know that
their gains depend upon the sins which their penitents commit. Friars
do not osten visit places where gain is not to be got. They have an
outward appearance of poverty and sanctity, without the reality.

I do not desire that they should be altogether suppressed, but that
. they should be kept under due discipline.

CAP. XVIII. Some friars aim at dignity as masters in the schools,
and then they are exempted from their rule and obtain entry into great
houses. The influence of the friar is everywhere felt, and often he sup-
plies the place of the absent husband and is the father of his children.
Bees, when they wound, lose their stings and are afterwards helpless :
would it were so with the adulterous friar!

CAP. XIX. The order of friars is not necessary to the Church.
Friars appropriate spiritual rights which belong to others ; and though
this may be by dispensation of the pope, yet we know that the pope
cloes not grant such dispensations of his own motion, and he may be
deceived. They ask for the cure of souls, but in fact they are demand-
ing worldly wealth: not so did Francis make petition‚ but he left all
and endured poverty.

CAP. XX. This multitude of friars is not necessary for the good of
society. David says of them that they neither take part in the labours
