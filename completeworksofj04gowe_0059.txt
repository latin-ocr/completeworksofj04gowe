effectual resistance. Lovers are blind and are driven by every kind of
unreasonable impulse. Women deceive men, and men also deceive
and betray women.

CAP. IV. The knight has little need to fear bodily wounds, which
may easily be healed 3 but love is not to be cured by physicians, and
this deprives him both of reason and of honour.

CAP. V. Those who seek fame and worldly honours only, are hardly
better than those who are conquered by women.

CAP. VI. The good woman is one whose praise is above all things.
The bad is a subtle snare for the destruction of men. She paints her
face and uses every art to deceive. The world is treacherous, but
woman is more treacherous still.

CAP. VII. The good knight, who labours neither for gain nor for
glory, and is not conquered by Iove, obtains the victory over the
enemies of the Church and of his country, and gives us the blessing of
peace.

CAP. VIII. The bad knight is the causer of many evils in the other
orders of society. He deserves to have Leah, not Rachel, as his bride.
Those who follow wars for the sake of the spoils are like vultures that
prey upon the corpses of the dead. Alas, in these days gold is pre-
ferred to honour and the world to God.

CAP. IX. Another estate remains, that of the cultivators of the soil,
who provide sustenance for the human race in accordance with the
divine ordinance laid down for Adam. These at the present time are
lazy and grasping, as well as few in number3 one peasant now asks
more wages than two did in past time, and one formerly did as much
work as three do nOW. We know from recent experience what evil the
peasant is capable of doing. God has ordained, however, that nothing
is to be had without toi13 therefore the peasant must labour, and if he
will not, he must be compelled.

CAP. X. There are also the casual labourers, who go from one
employment to another and always find fault with the food that they
get from their masters. These are irrational like beasts, and they
should be disciplined by fear of punishment.

CAP. XI. In cities there are chiefly two classes, the merchants and
the craftsmen. The former sin by not regarding festivals and holy
days.

CAP. XII. Usury and Fraud are two sisters, daughters of Avariceâ€š
to whom the dwellers in cities pay honour. Usury is forbidden of old,
but by a gloss on the text it is now approved.

CAP. XIII. Fraud is worse, because it is common to all places.
From the young apprentice to the master all practise it in selling.

CAP. XIV. Craftsmen, who make things, follow the laws of Fraud,

and so do those who sell articles of food, as meat, fish, bread, beer, and
so on.
