lxxvi GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

Of the above errors several, as we have said, are reproduced by
Wright with no authority from his MS. ¹, but otherwise his text is
a tolerably correct representation of that given by the Cotton MS„
and the same may be said with regard to the other poems Carmen
super multiplici Viciorum Pestilencicz, De Lucis Scrutim'o ², &c.

THE PREsENT EDITION. The text is in the main that of S,
which is supplemented, where it is defective, by C. The Cotton
MS. is also the leading authority for those pieces which are not
contained in S, as the four last poems.

For the Vox Clamantis four manuscripts have been collated
with S word for word throughout, viz. CHDL, and two more, viz.
GE, have been collated generally and examined for every doubtful
passage. TH2 have been carefully examined and taken as authorities
for the original text of some of the revised passages.

As regards the record of the results of these rather extensive
collations, it may be stated generally that all material variations
of C and H from the text of S have been recorded in the critical
notes ³. The readings of E, D and L have been printed regularly
for those passages in which material variations of other MSS. are
recorded, and in such cases, if they are not mentioned, it may be
assumed that they agree with S 3 but otherwise they are mentioned
only when they seem to deserve attention. The readings of G are
recorded in a large number of instances‚ but they must not be
assumed ex silentio, and those of T and H2 are as a rule only
given in passages where they have a different version of the text.

A trifling liberty has been taken with the text of the MSS. in
regard to the position of the conjunction ‘que' (and). This is

¹ e. g. i. 209 Regem 219 Qui est ii. 9 sociatus 114 de pondere
266 Pontifice.

2 A few errors may be noted in the poem De Lucis Scrutinio, viz. l. 15
manifestus 36 oculis 66 similatam 89 Ominis (sor O nimis) :
also in ‘O deus immense‚' 1. 28 se (for te) 104 sub (sor sue).

⁸ Trissing differences of spelling are as a rule not recorded. Examples of
such variations are the following in C t i. 1 ut 11 uidet 23 choruschat
120 talamum 137 sydera 139 themone 141 δερ. sed (for set)
196 &c. amodo 234 prohdolor 311 Immundos 586 Egiptus
1056 Symonis 1219 Ocupat 1295 suppremis 1505 loquturus
1514 Obstetit 1755 opprobrium 18321itt0ra 1947 litora 2094 patiens
ii. Prol. 11 etiam ii. 57 fatie 261 Moise 494 synagoga iii. 291 red-
ditus, &c. Variation in the use of capital letters or in regard to the separation

of‘ que,' ‘ ve‚' &e. from the words which they follow is usually not recorded.
The spelling of H and G is almost identical with that of S.
