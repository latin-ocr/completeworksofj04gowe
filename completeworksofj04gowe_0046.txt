xxxvi GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

are Cut and Cur from their wretched kennels, the sheep-dog and the
watch-dog‚ the baker's, the butcher's‚ and the miller's dog. The one-
eyed is there and the three-legged dog limps behind barking. These
cannot be soothed by stroking‚ but bare their teeth in anger against
you. They tear all whom they meet, and the more they devour the
less they are satisfied. Cerberus in hell hears their howl, and break-
ing away from his chains hejoins himself to their company and becomes
their leader. More savage were these than the hounds which tore
Acteon or the beast which Diana sent to destroy the Athenians. All
trembled before them.

CAP. VI. Another band took the form of foxes and cats. They ran
about and searched every cavern and every hiding-place, and made
their way into secret chambers. There was venom in their bite. The
caves of the wood send forth the foxes, who rob by day without sear,
and have a treaty of peace with the dogs. The cats leave the barns
and cease to catch mice, and these do damage more than ever did the
mice of Ekron. ’

CAP. VII. A sixth took the form of domestic fowls, but they claimed
to be birds of prey. The cock had the beak and claws of a falcon,
ancl the goose soared up to the heaven. Suddenly the cock becomes
a carrion-crow and the goose a kite, and they prey upon the carcasses

him to evil. The goose which formerly frightened only children with
its hissing, now terrifies grown men and threatens to tear them to
pieces.

Owls join themselves to these and do by day the deeds of darkness,
sharpening their feathers with iron, in order that they may slay men.

CAP. VIII. The dream continued, and I saw another band in the
form of flies and of frogs. These were like those that plagued Egypt ε
the frogs came into houses and shed their poison everywhere ς the flies
pursued with their stings all those of gentle blood, and nothing could
keep them out. Their prince Belzebub was the leader of the host.
The heat of the summer produced them suddenly in swarms z the fly
was more rapacious than the hawk and prouder than the peacock; he
contended with the lark, the crane and the eagle in ssight.

This was a day on which horses were overcome by asses, and lions
by oxen, a day in which the dog was stronger than the bear and the
cat than the leopard, a day in which the weak confounded the strong,
a day in which slaves were raised on high and nobles brought to the
ground, a day in which the terror of God’s wrath came upon all,
such a day as no chronicle records in time past. May such a day
never come again in our age 3

CAP. IX. When all this multitude was gathered together like the

sand of the sea, one, a Jay skilled in speech, took the first place
among them and addressed them thus ε ‘ O wretched slaves, now comes
