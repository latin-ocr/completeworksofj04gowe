xx INTRODUCTION

October 1894, and was placed on the supposed site of the chapel
of St. John the Baptist, where it now stands ¹.

In the course of nearly five centuries the tornb has undergone
many changes, and the present colouring and inscription are not
original. What we have now is a canopy of three arches over an
altar tomb, on which lies an effigy of the poet, habited in a long
dark-coloured gown‚ with a standing cape and buttoned down to
his feet, wearing a gold collar of SS, fastened in front with
a device of a chained swan between two portcullises. His head
rests on a pile of three folio volumes marked with the names of
his three principal works, Vox Clamantis, Speculum Medffizntis,
Confessio Amantis. He has a rather round face with high cheek-
bones, a moustache and a slightly forked beard, hair long and
curling upwards²‚ and round his head a chaplet of four red roses
at intervals upon a band ³, with the words ‘ merci ihs ⁴ ' (repeated)
in the intervals between the roses: the hands are put together
and raised in prayer: at the feet there is a lion or mastiff lying.
The upper ledge of the tomb has this inscription, ‘Hic iacet
Ι. Gower Arm. Angl. poeta celeberrimus ac huic sacro edificio
benefac. insignis. Vixit temporibus Edw. III et Ric. ΙΙ et Henr. IV.'
In front of the tomb there are seven arched niches. Against the
wall at the end of the recess, above the feet of the figure, a shield

¹ 1 am indebted sor some of the facts to Canon Thompson of St. Saviour’s,
Southwark, who has been kind enough to answer several questions which
1 addressed to him.

² The features are quite different, it seems to me, from those represented
in the Cotton and Glasgow MSS„ and Ι think it more likely that the latter
give us a true contemporary portrait. Gower certainly died in advanced
age, yet the effigy on his tomb shows us a man in the flower of life. This
then is either an ideal representation or must have been executed from
rather distant memory, whereas the miniatures in the MSS„ which closely
resemble each other, were probably from life, and also preserve their origInal
colouring. The miniatures in MSS. osthe Confessio Amantis, which represent
the Confession, show the penitent usually as a conventional young lover.
The picture in the Fairfax MS. is too much damaged to give us much
guidance, but it does not seem to be a portrait, in spite os the collar of SS
added later. The miniature in MS. Bodley 902, however, represents an
aged man, while that of the Cambridge MS. Mm. 2. 21 rather recalls the effigy
on the tomb and may have been suggested by it.

³ We may note that the effigy of Sir Robert Gower in brass above his tomb
in Brabourne church is represented as having a similar chaplet round his
helmet. See the drawing in MS. Harl. 3917, f. 77.

⁴ So Ι read them. They are given by Gough and others as ‘ merci ihi!
