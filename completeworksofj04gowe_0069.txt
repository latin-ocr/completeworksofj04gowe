MANUSCRIPTS lix

seen in some Gower MS. a selection of sententious passages from
the Vox Clamanffs and other places, such as we actually have on
one of the blank leaves of the Digby MS. (f. 160), beginning
‘ Vulturis est hominum natura cadauera velle,' again one of those
allegories of bird nature which were borrowed by Gower from the
Aurora.

It may be noted here that in the same passage of Bale's un-
published papers we have the following statement:

⁴ De triplici opere hoe carmen est super eius tumbam editum,
Quos viuens legi libros nunc offero regi,
Cuius habent legi secula cuncta regi.'

Also the following is given as the epitaph of his wife,

‘Quam bonitas, pietas, elemosina, casta voluntas,
Sobrietas que fides coluerunt, hic iacet Agnes.
onr amans, humilis Gower fuit illa Ioannis :

Donet ei summus celica regna Deus.²

These statements seem to be given by Bale on the authority of
Nieholas Brigham‚ to whom we owe the tomb of Chaucer in
Westminster Abbey.

Latin pieces are contained in the Trentham MS. of the Praise of
peace and the Ciukante Balades (described in vol. i. p. lxxix),
and the Cronica Tripertita occurs separately in the Bodleian MS.
Hatton 92. Copies of the Carmen de multiplici Viciorum Pesti-
lencia are contained in some MSS. of the Confessio Amantis, viz.
TBAP2 of the second recension, and FH2K of the third, and
with regard to these the reader is referred to the account given of
the manuscripts in the Introduction to the second volume of this
edition.

Of the four manuscripts of the Vm⁸ clamantis with other yatin
poems, which have been referred to as contemporary with the
author, one is at Oxtbrd, in the library of All Souls College, one
at Glasgow in the Hunterian Museum, and two in London. They
