king of altering the Rolls of Parliament ‘contra effectum concessionis
praedictae.'

35 ff. Cp. Annales Ric. ll, p. 225.

47. ραι» non audiuit auris, ἃς. The same expression is used by
Adam of Usk about the king's proceedings in this parliament at
Shrewsbury (p. 17).

49 ff. These transactions are related, but not very intelligibly, in the
continuation of the Eulogium Historiarum, iii. 378. It seems that the
king summoned the archbishop and bishops to his Council at Notting-
ham, and used theirinfluence to obtain from the city of London and the
seventeen counties adjacent acknowledgements of guilt and payments
of money to procure pardon. After this the king ordered that the arch-
bishops‚ bishops‚ abbots, δία, and also the individual citizens of towns,
should set their seals to blank parchments, wherein afterwards a pro-
mise to keep the statutes of the last parliament was inscribed, to which
it was supposed that the king intended to add acknowledgements placing
the persons in question and their property at his own disposal: cp.
Monk of Eveshamj p. 147. These last are the ‘blanche—chartres’
spoken of below called ‘ blanke chartours ’ in Gregory’s Chronicle‚
p. 101, where the form of submission sent in by the city of London,
‘in plesauns of the kynge and by conselle and helpe of Syr Roger
Walden, Archebischoppe of Cauntyrbury ande Syr Robert Braybroke,
Byschoppe of London‚' is given in full, pp. 98-100. See also Rot.
Parl. iii. 426, 432, where they are referred to as ‘les Remembrances
appellez Raggemans ou blanches Chartres.’

73. phas-ism: that is, hypocritically submissive to the king.

77. melior: comparative sor superlative ; so ‘ probacior‚’ 1. 79.

85 f. Gower attributes Henry’s exile to what was probably the true
cause, namely the king’s jealousy of his popularity and sear that he
might take the lead in opposition to the newly established arbitrary
system of government. The very occasion of the quarrel with the
duke of Norfolk, an allegation on the part of Henry that the duke of
Norfolk had warned him of danger from Richard and had said that
the king could not be trusted to keep his oaths, made it difficult to take
more summary measures against him at that moment. Indeed it
seems probable that the conversation was reported to the king with a
view to obtain a contradiction of the design imputed to him. Adam
of Usk says definitely that the king’s object in appointing the duel at
Coventry was to get rid of Henry, and that Richard had been assured
by astrologers that the duke of Norfolk would win ; but that on seeing
them in the lists he was convinced that Henry would be the victor,
and therefore he broke off the duel and banished both, intending
