406 CRONICA TRIPERTITA

58. Troia, i. e. London.

65. The ear] of Oxford, lately created duke of Ireland‚¹ whose badge
was a boar‘s head, was Chief Justice of Chester in this year, and there
raised forces for the king, with the assistance of Thomas MolyneuX,
Constable of Chester‚ ‘cuius nutum tota illa provincia expectabat‚'
Walsingham, ii. p. 167 (Rolls Series, 28. 2).

80. Telis: see note on Vox clamantis, vii. 1067: a parte means
apparently ⁴ on one side,' or perhaps ‘on the side of the victors.’

The place where this affair happened is not very well described by
the authorities, but it seems clear that the first attempt of the earl of
Oxford (or duke of Ireland) to cross the river was made at Radcot
(Knighton, Rolls Series, ii. 253). Here he found the bridge partly
broken, so that one horseman only could cross it at a time, and guarded
by men-at-arms and archers set there by the ear} of Derby. At the same
time he was threatened with attack by the earl of Derby himself on the
one side and the duke of Gloucester on the other, both apparently on
the northern bank of the river. NVaIsingham says that he went on to
another bridge, and, finding this also guarded, plunged in on horseback
and escaped by swimming over the river. Knighton gives us to under-
stand that he was prevented by the appearance of the duke of Glou-
cester's force from making his way along the northern bank, and at
once plunged in and swam the stream, ‘ et sic mirabili ausu evasit ab
eis.’ Walsingham adds that he was not pursued, because darkness had
come on (it was nearly the shortest day of the year) and they did not
know the country. This chronicler does not mention Radcot Bridge, but
refers to the place vaguely as ‘iuxta Burford, prope Babbelake.’ It is
impossible, however, that either the fight, such as it was, or the escape
ofthe earl of Oxford can have taken place at Bablock Hythe. No doubt
the lords returned to Oxford aster the affair bythis serry, which was prob-
ably the shortest way. The earl of Oxford seems to have made his way
to London, and after an interview with the king to have embarked at
Queenborough for the Continent (Malveme, in Rolls Series, 41. 9,

. 112).
p 89 ff. The marginal note speaks ofthe ‘castra, que ipse [Comes Oxonie]
familie sue pro signo gestanda attribuerat? The cognizance referred, no
doubt, to the city of Chester. The same note tells us that the duke of
Gloucester bore a fox-tail on his spear as an ensign: cp. Harding’s
Chronicle, p. 341 :

‘The foxe taile he bare ay on his spere,
XVhere so he rode in peace or elles in warre.’

103. lVoua villa Affaceda, i. e. Alexander N eville: a very bad attempt
on the part of our author.

104. maledixit. The particular form of curse in this case was trans-
lation to the see of S. Andrew, which he could not occupy because
Scotland was Clementine.

107. Hic proceres edit, ἃς. He is· said to have especially urged
