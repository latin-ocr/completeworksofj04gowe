xxvi INTRODUCTION

To the information which we derive from records must be
added that which is to be drawn from the poet’s own writings.
From the Speculum Meditantis we learn that in early life he com-
posed love poems, which he calls ‘ fols ditz d’ amour ' (27340)‚
and from two other passages (ll. 8794 and 17649) we may
perhaps assume that he was already married at the time when this
work was composed. In the former, speaking of those who tell
tales to husbands about their wives' misconduct‚ he says in effect,
⁴ I for my part declare <⁵ Je di pour moi ⁹) that Ι wish to hear no
such tales of my wife :' in the second he speaks of those wives who
dislike servants and other persons simply because their husbands
like them, and he adds, ‘I do not say that mine does so ’ (‘ Ne di
pas q' ensi fait la moie'). If the inference be correct, his union
with Agnes Groundolf in his old age was a second marriage. We
cannot come to any definite conclusion from this poem about any
profession or occupation which he may have had besides literature.
The statement of Leland that he practised as a lawyer seems
rather improbable, in view of the way in which he here speaks of
lawyers and their profession. Of all the secular estates that of
the law seems to him to be the worst (2408 5 ff.)‚ and he condemns
both advocates and judges in a more unqualified manner than the
members of any other calling. Especially the suggestion of a
special tax to be levied on lawyers' gains (24337 ff.) is one that
could hardly have come from one who was himself a lawyer ¹.

Again the way in which he speaks of physicians (24301‚
2 5621 ff.) seems almost equally to exclude him from the profession
of medicine.

Of all the various ranks of society which he reviews‚ that of
which he speaks with most respect is the estate of Merehants.

¹ At the same time I am disposed to attach some weight to the expression
in Mir. 21774‚ where the author says that some may blame him sor handling
sacred subjects‚ because he is no ‘ clerk,'

‘Ainz ai vestu la raye manche)

This may possibly mean only to indicate the dress os a layman, but on the
other hand it seems clear that some lawyers, perhaps especially the
¹ apprenticii ad legem‚’were distinguished by stripes upon their sleeves3 see
for example the painting reproduced in Pulling‘s Order ostlze Cot's(ed. 1897);
and serjeants-at·law are referred to in Piers Plowmtm, A text, Pass. iii. 277, as
wearing a ‘ ray robe with rich pelure.’ We must admit, therefore, the

possibility that Gower was bred to the law, though he may not have practised
it sor a living.
