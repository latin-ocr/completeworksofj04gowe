MANUSCRIPTS lxv

Trtjzberlita, ἃς. The last quire of that book, ff. 158-164 (one leaf lost
at the end), has several blanks (162, 163, 164 v0).

In a good many instances passages of from two to six lines are
omitted in the text and inserted in the margin, either across or at the
bottom of the page, in a hand which seems not to be that of the text,
though very similar, and is probably identical with S (1). This occurs
on ff· 41, 74, 76, 78, &c-

The text of H is very correct, and in forms of spelling, &c. it closely
resembles that of S. There is little punctuation at first, but more after-
wards. In form of text it agrees nearly with C, but (Ι) the marginal note
at iv. 587 is omitted, (2) as regards revision H parts company with C at vi.
1219, from which point H has the unrevised text in agreement with EDTH,
except in the concluding lines of the Vox Clamantis on f. 134, which, as
already remarked, are rewritten in a new hand.

The hands of H may be thus distinguished:

(1) Text of the Vox Chzmantis, a good and regular fourteenth-century
hand.

(2) Passages added in the margin, probably the same as S (1).

(3) Rewritten text of i. 1019 ff., vi. 545—580‚ vi. cap. xviii and heading of
xix, last lines of Vox Clamantis, text os Cronz'ca Tripertita and succeeding
pieces to the end of ‘ O deus immense ' f. 159 v0. This is the same as S (2),

G (ε), c (3)-

(4) Rewritten text of iii. 1 fs„ corrections of iv. 1212, 1214, and rewritten
text of 1221*-1232*; also f. 160, ‘Nota hic in fine' &c. to end of f. 161 το.
This is the same as C (4).

(5) Correction of the heading of iii. cap. iv, the same as S (3).

(6) Marginal note at iii. 375, the same as S (4), G (4), C (6).

(7) Corrections of vi. 1208, 1210, and of Crom'ca Tm‘pertita i. 55 f. and some
other places ε the same as C (7).

(8) Rewritten passages at the beginning and near the end of the Cronica
Trapertita, the same as C (12).

(9) Second copy of the last poems (on f. 164), the same hand as C (11).

Sotheby, who very kindly sent it to the Bodleian Library sor my use.
Contains V ox clamantis, Carmen super multiplici Vz‘cz’orum pestilencia,
Tractatus de Lucis Scrutz'nio, ‘ O deus immense,' ‘ Cultor in ecclesia‚’
‘Vnanimes esse,' ‘Dicunt scripture.’ Parchment, ff. 191, measuring
about 9x6} in., in quires of eight with catch-words, the last quire
of seven leaves only (two blank). Neatly written in a good hand
of the end of the fourteenth century, in single column, 32 lines to
a page. On f. 10 a brightly coloured picture of an archer drawing
a bow to shoot at the world, with the lines ‘Ad 'mundum mitto‚’ &c.‚
as in the Cotton and Glasgow MSS„ but the figure and features are
different, and evidently the picture has less claim to be considered
an authentic portrait than those of the two MSS. above named.

The headings of pages and chapters are in red, and there are coloured
