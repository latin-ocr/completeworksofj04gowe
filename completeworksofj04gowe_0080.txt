lxx GOWER'S LATIN WORKS

H2. HATFIELD HALL, in the possession of the Marqucss ofSalisbury,
by whose kind permission I was allowed to examine it. Contains the
Vox Clamantis, preceded by the Table of Chapters. Parchment‚ ff. 144
(not counting blanks), about 9}><6-}in.‚ in eighteen quires of eight
with catchwords; neatly written in a hand of the first half of the fif-
teenth century, 40 lines to the page. There is a richly illuminated
border round three sides of the page where the Prologue of the
Vox clamantis begins, and also on the next, at the beginning of the
first book, and floreated decorations at the beginning of each
succeeding book, with illuminated capitals throughout. The catch—
words are sometimes ornamented with neat drawings.

The book has a certain additional interest derived from the fact that
it belonged to the celebrated Lord Burleigh, and was evidently read by
him with some interest, as is indicated by various notes.

This MS„ of which the text is fairly correct, is written in one hand
throughout, and with T it represents, so far as we can judge, the original
form of the text in all the revised passages. In some few cases, as iv. 1073,
v. 450, H2 seems to give the original reading, where T agrees with the re-

vised MSS.

On the last leaf we find an interesting note about the decoration of the
book and the parchment used, written small in red below the ‘Explicit,' which
I read as follows ι · 100 and li. 51 blew letteris, 4 co. smale letteris and more,
gold letteris 8 : 18 quayers. price velom v s. vi d.’ There are in fact about
150 of the larger blue initials with red lines round them, the smaller letters,
of which Ι understand the account reckons 400 and more, being those at the
beginning of paragraphs‚ blue and red alternately. The eight gold letters
are those at the beginning of the first prologue and the seven books.

The following notes are in the hand of Lord Burleigh, as Ι am informed
by Mr. R. T. Gunton z ‘Vox Clamantis ' on the first page, ‘ nomine Authoris '
and ‘ Anno 4 Regis Ricardi ’ in the margin of the prologue to the first book,
‘Thomas arch., Simon arch.,¹ opposite i. 1055 f., ‘Amoris effectus’ near the
beginning of Lib. v, ‘ Laus Edw. princ. patris Ricardi 2¹ at Lib. vi. cap. xiii,
and a few more.

C2. COTTON, TITUS, A, 13, Eritish Museum. Contains on ff. 105—
137 a part of the Vox Clamantis, beginning with the Prologue of Lib. i.
and continuing to Lib. iii. l. 116, where it is left unfinished. Paper,
leaves measuring 8} ›< 6 in. written in a current sixteenth-century hand
with an irregular number of lines (about 38—70) to the page. Headed,
‘ De populari tumultu et rebellione. Anno quarto Ricardi secundi!

Text copied from D, as is shown by minute agreement in almost every
particular.

H 3. HATTON 92, Bodleian Library, Oxsord. This contains, among
other things of a miscellaneous kind, Gower's Crom'ca T rzjfiertz'ta,
followed by ‘[H.] aquile pullus,’ ‘O recolende‚’ and ‘Rex celi
