xxxviii GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

opens its gates to them, and they surge in and invade the streets and
houses. It was Thursday, the festival of Corpus Christi, when this
fury attacked the city on all sides; they burnt the houses and slew the
citizens. The Savoy burns, and the house of the Baptist falls to ruin
in the flames. They rob and carry away the spoil, and that day is
closed with drunkenness everywhere.

The next day, Friday, is yet worse; no ‚wisdom or courage avails
against them, they rage like a lioness robbed of her young. O, how
degenerate is the city which allows this, how disgraceful that armed
knights should give place to an unarmed mob 1 There is no Capaneus
or Tydeus, no Ajax or Agamemnon, no Hector or Achilles, to make
defence or attack. Ilion with its towers cannot keep rnen safe from
the furies.

CAP. XIV. Helenus the chief priest‚ who kept the palladium of
Troy, was slain in spite of his exhortations. These were deeds
worthy rather of demons than of men. Piety and virtue perished
and vice ran riot. They said ‘Let his blood be upon our heads‚'
and slew him without pity: the curse of Christ shall fall upon them
for this deed.

Simon had the same death as Thomas, but at the hands of greater
numbers and for a different cause. Vengeance came for the death of
Thomas3 for Simon it daily threatens. It was midday when this
blood was shed, the shepherd was slain by his flock‚ the father by his
children. He died untimely ; but though taken away from us, he lives
in heaven. This is the foulest of all the deeds done: these men are
worse than Cain, who only slew his brother. O cursed hand that
struck the severed head! Wail for this, all ye old and young, the
evils prophesied by Cassandra come down on this city. The king could
not rescue Helenus, but he mourned for him in his heart.

CAP. XV. The chief citizens also perished, there was death and
sorrow everywhere. 1f a son pleaded for his father, both were slain.
No place of safety can be found by those of gentle condition ; they fiee
to the forests in vain, and move vaguely hither and thither, neither city
nor field affords them protection. Death is everywhere, and spares
not even the women and the children. There is no remedy, and neither
lamentation nor prayers are of any avail.

CAP. XVI. When 1 saw all this, horror seized me and I fled. I left
my own house and wandered over the fields, 1 went from place to
place in search of safety ; the enemy pressed after me ; I hid in caves of
the woods, and was without hope at evening of what the morrow might
bring. My dreams terrified me and my heart melted like wax in the
fire. I lay hid during the day and trembled at every sound‚ the tears
that I shed were my sole subsistence. I was alone and in terror of the
wrath of God, my rnind was sick and my body was wasted. Hardly
ever did Ι meet a companion, and those friends whom I had trusted in
