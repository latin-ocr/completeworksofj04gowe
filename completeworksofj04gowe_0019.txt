LIFE OF GOWER ix

All this seems to suggest that Leland had no very trustworthy
evidence on the matter. He continued to assert, however, as we
have seen, that the poet derived his origin from Stitenham, and
to this he adds that he was brought up and practised as a lawyer,
‘Coluit forum et patrias leges lucri causa¹.' It has not been
noticed that the author's manuscript has here in the margin what
is probably a reference to authority for this statement: we find
there a note in a contemporary hand, ‘Goverus seruiens ad legem
30 Ed. 3.' From this it is probable that Leland is relying on the
Year-book of 30 Ed. ΙΙΙ, where we find the name Gower‚ apparently
as that of a serjeant-at-law who took part in the proceedings. It
is not likely that Leland had any good reasons for identifying this
Gower‚ who was in a fairly high position at the bar in the year
1 3 56, with John Gower the poet, who died in 1408 ².

Leland's statements were copied by Bale and so became public
property. They did not, however, long pass unchallenged.
Thynne in his Animadversions acutely criticises the suggestion of
Yorkshire origin, on the ground of the difference of arms :——‘ Bale
hath much mistaken it, as he hath done infinite things in that book,
being for the most part the collections of Leland. For in truth
the arms of Sir John Gower being argent, on a cheveron azure
three leopards’ heads or, do prove that he came of a contrary house
to the Gowers of Stytenham in Yorkshire, who bare barruly of
argent and gules, a cross paty flory sable. Which difference of
arms seemeth a difference of families, unless you can prove that
being of one family they altered their arms upon some just occa-
sion.' The arms to which Thynne refers as those of Gower the
poet are those which are to be seen upon his tomb3 3 and the
argument is undoubtedly sound. Thynne proceeds to criticise
Speght's statement that Chaucer and Gower were both lawyers of
the Inner Temple: ‘You say, It seemeth that these learned men
were of the Inner Temple, for that many years since Master Buck-
ley did see a record in the same house, where Geffrey Chaucer

¹ Smpt. Brit. i. 414. This statement also appears as a later addition in the
manuscript.

² ‘Gower’ appears in Tottil's publication of the Year-books (1585) both
in 29 and 30 Ed. 111, e.g. 29 Ed. 111, Easter term, ff. 20, 27, 33, 46, and
30 Ed. 111, Michaelmas term, ff. 16, 18, 20 v0. He appears usually as counsel,
buton some occasions he speaks apparently as a judge. The Year-books
of the succeeding years, 31—36 Ed. ΙΙΙ, have not been published.

³ These arms appear also in the Glasgovv MS. of the Vox Clamantis.
