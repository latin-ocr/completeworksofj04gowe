where, which conceals the foulness within by a fair show without. Yet
it will not escape detection.

CAP. IV. Things that were good are now changed into the opposite
forms, truth into falsehood‚ wisdom into folly, love into lust, learned
into ignorant3 servants are become masters and masters servants.
Nothing pleases now but flattery. Courts do not keep their former
honour : knights there are in plenty, but little valour. XVeakness
grows and strength is depressed, there is much talk but little action, the
burdens of war without the advantages. Justice has departed and
fraud has taken its place3 even those of one family feel envy and hatred
one against another. Friendship is treacherous and seeks gain like
a harlot: hatred is everywhere common, but love is as the phenix.
There is no saith anywhere, and the right hand cannot trust the left.
All cry out against the world and say that it is growing worse and
worse.

CAP. V. The world is indeed full of evil and impurity, and this life
is a perpetual warfare, in which all that is good perishes and all that is
evil prevails. Even the elements of the world change and pass away,
and much more human things. No degree is exempted : the hearts of
kings are disturbed by fear of change, and terrors prevail in spite
of royal banquets and bodyguards.

CAP. VI. Man was created sor the service of God, and the world

CAP. VII. All things were put under his feet, and were made to
minister to him. He ought therefore to remember whence he is and
who gave him these things. Again, when by man's sin the race of man
was corrupted, the Creator himself restored and redeemed it, taking
the form of a servant. Man ought therefore to confess him as Lord
and follow his precepts with a devout mind.

CAP. VIII. Man is a microcosm or lesser world, and according as
he does ill or well, the greater world is good or bad. Man ought there·
fore to aim at high things, and not to submit himself to the rule of sin.

CAP. IX. When death comes, when the throat is dry and the face
bloodless, when the eyes are fixed and the tongue silent, when the
pulse beats no more and the feet can no longer move, what then will
the proud man say? The body in which he prided himself is now food
for worms, his strength is less than that of a fly, and his beauty is turned
into loathing. His wealth and his pomp avail him no longer, the
serpent is his attendant and the charnel—house is his bed-chamber.

CAP. X. The envious man, who once gnawed upon others, is now
himself devoured ε he who laughed at the misfortunes of others, laughs
now no more 3 the heart that so much murmured now suffers putre·
faction3 the sting of envy can pierce no more.

CAP. XI. He who was full of anger, now cannot move his head;
