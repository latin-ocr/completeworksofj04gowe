0312. bis deno Rz'cardz‘ regis z‘n anno. The twentieth year of Richard ΙΙ

Arundel and Cloucester took place in the first few days of the twenty-
first year.

DE LUCIS SCRUTINIO (p. 355)

The Ecton MS. (E) gives a different form of the marginal notes, as
follows : 6. Nota de luce prelatorum et curatorum. 18. Nota
de luce professorum. 30. Nota de luce regum. 44. Nota de
luce procerum. 51. Nota de luce militum. 58. Nota de luce
legistarum et causidicorum. 67. Nota de luce mercatorum.
79. Nota de luce vulgari in patria. 89. Nota quod Iohannes Gower
auctor huius libri hic in fine tenebras deplangens pro luce optinenda
deum exorat.

25 ff. See Prasse of Peace, 225 ff.

64 f. Cp. Vox Clamanlis, v. 703.

91 ff. The language is of course figurative: we must not assume

ECCE PATET TENSUS ETe. (ρ’. 358)

This piece is found in the Trentham MS. f. 33 vo, following the
Cinkam‘e Balades. It is probably imperfect at the end, the manuscript

EST AMOR ETc. (p. 359)

This piece occurs also in combination with the Traitie': see vol. i.
p. 392. For the substance of it cp. Vox clamantis, v. 53 ff.

QUIA VNUSQUISQUE Em (p. 360)

The form given by G is practically identical with that of the Fairfax
MS. That of the text, as given by SCH, varies from it in the first
paragraph, where it adopts the wording found in the second recension
copies, BTA. See vol. iii. pp. 479 and 550.

10. The word ‘meditantis‘ is written over an erasure in G.

11 ff. This paragraph, as finally rewritten‚ seems intended to include
the Crom'ca Trajan-lita as a sequel to the Vox Clamantis: cp. p. 313,
where in the note which connects the two works Ianguage is used very
similar to that which we have here. The author in his retrospective
