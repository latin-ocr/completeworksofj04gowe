sound feels no hurt. Thus, isthe reader is not guilty of the faults spoken
of, he will pass untouched by the reproof.

1470. ‘ Vox populi, vox dei ' : a sentiment repeated by our author in
various forms 3 cp. note on iii. Prol. 11.

1479 ff. These last three lines are over erasure in SC HG. They seem
to have been substituted for the original couplet in order to point more
clearly the moral of the cronica Triperlz'la, which is intended for a
practical illustration ofthe divine punishment of sin.

Explicit, ἃς. It will be seen that in these later years Gower has
almost brought himself to believe that the events of the earlier part of
the reign were intended for a special warning to the youthfu] king,
whom he conceives as having then already begun a course of tyrannical
government. At the time, however, our author acquitted him of all
responsibility‚ on account of his youth.

11 ff. The swan was used as a badge by the duke of Gloucester and
also (perhaps not till after his death) by Henry of Lancaster. For the

horse and the bear as cognizances of Arundel and VVarwick see Annales
Ricardz' II (Rolls Series, 28. 3), p. 206.

CRONICA TRIPERTITA

1. Ista tripertita, Sec. These sevenlines must be regarded asametrical
preface to the Chronicle which follows. In the Hatton MS. these lines
with their marginal note are placed before the prose of the preceding
page (which is given in a sornewhat different form) and entitled
‘Prologus'

PRIMA PARS

1. Take the first letter of ‘mundus' and add to it C three times
repeated and six periods of five years, plus ten times five and seven.
The date thus indicated is MCCC -Ι- 30 ψ 57, i. e. 1387. For a similar
mode of expression cp. Richard of Maidstone⁷s poem on the Reconcilia-
lz'on (ff Richard II (Rolls Series, 14. 1),

6Μ. cape, ter quoque C. deciesque novem, duo iunge.’

4-12. These lines are written over an erasure in SCHG. The
original version of them is not extant, so far as I am aware.

51. Panna coronata. This, as the margin tells us, is the Earl Marshall,
that is Thomas Mowbray, earl of N ottingha1n‚ afterwards duke of
N orfolk.

52. Qui gerit S: the earl of Derby, from whose badge of S, stand-
ing probably for ‘ Soverein,’ came the device of the well-known collar
of SS. His tomb has the word ‘ Soverayne ’ repeated several times on
the canopy.

55. aquiloniae luna, ‘the northern moon,' that is, the earl of N orth-
umberland. The variation of the text in the Harleian M S„ written
over an erasure, arises no doubt from the later disagreement between
Henry IV and N orthumberland.
