lxiv GOWER'S LATIN WORKS

(2) The eight leaves preceding this (containing the chapter-headings), and
also ff. 96, 97 and part of 140. This hand has made corrections throughout,
not revising the text, as the author might, but setting right the mistakes of
the scribe.

The (3) following passages as rewritten over erasure : i. 1019 ff., vi.
545—554, and also the prose heading of the first part of the cronica Tm'pertita.
This is the ‘second hand ' of the Fairfax MS„ the same as S (2), G (2), H (3).

(4) The passage rewritten over erasure in iii. 1 ff.‚ also the heading of iii.
cap. iv.‚ corrections in iv. 1198 ff, and iv. 1221*-1232* rewritten over
erasure. This is a neat round hand used also in the same places of the
Harleian MS.

(5) The passage ‘ Rex puer,’ Sec„ vi. 555·580, and vi. cap. xviii, with the
heading of cap. xix.‚ over erasure, a hand which resembles (3), but does not
seem to be identical with it.

(6) The marginal note at iii. 375 and perhaps also iv. 587, and the marginal
note at the end of the Crom'ca Trzpertita; also f. 176 ‘ Nota hic in fine—intend0‚'
and the lines ‘ Henrici regis,' &c. This is the same as S (4), G (4), H (6).

(7) Corrections in vi. 1208, 1210: the same as H (7), and the correction
of vi. 1210 in S.

(8) Corrections in vi. 1219 ff.‚ and vii. 187 ff.

(9) Text of cronica Tripertita and the succeeding pieces to f. 168 ι a rather
rough and irregular hand in saded ink.

(10) Marginal notes of Cronz'ca Tm'pertt'ta and text of Carmen super multi-
pacisce. from f. 169, ‘Ad fidei dampnum’ to the end of ‘O deus immense‚’
f. 176.

(11) The four smaller poems at the end (possibly with the exception of
¹ Cultor in ecclesia '). The same as H (9).

(12) The lines at the beginning and near the end of the Cronica Trz'pertita
(over erasure). ,

Some other corrections are doubtful, as the concluding lines of the Vox
clamantis.

H. HARLEIAN 6291, British Museum. Contains the same as C,
except where deficient from loss of leaves, with the addition of a second
copy of the last three poems. Parchment ff. 164, measuring 9 >< 6 in.‚
in quires of eight with catchwords‚ 37 lines to the page, regularly and
neatly written. No decoration except coloured initials. Has lost
probably two whole quires, 16 leaves, at the beginning, and begins
with Vox clamantis, i. 502. The first existing quire islettered ‘ b,’ and
this is also the lettering of the third quire of the Cotton MS„ the first,
which has the Table of Chapters, not being counted in the lettering.
In addition to these, one leaf is lost after f. 1 (containing Vox Cla-
712a72tz‘5, i. 571—644), two after f. 58 (iii. 17164854), one after f. 108 (vi.
951—1021)‚ one after f. 133 (vii. 1399—1466). This last leafformed part
of a quire of 12, which followed f. 124, at the end of the Vox Clanmntis.
Of these the last three have been cut away, but only one leaf of text is
lost, f. 134 continuing at 1467, and the concluding lines of the Vox
Clamanlz's being here given in the hand which copied the Cronica
