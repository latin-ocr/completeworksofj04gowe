VOX CLAMANTIS. ANALYSIS xxxix

prosperity failed me now. I dared scarcely speak a word, lest Ι should
betray myself to an enemy.

Then, when Ι saw nothing but death about me, I desired to die, and
yet I was unwilling to perish in so desolate a state. While I wept, lo,
Wisdom came to me and bade me stop my tears, for grief would at
some time cease. I stood amazed and in doubt; death was life to me
and life was death, and wondrous visions passed before me.

CAP. XVII. Ι saw not far offa Ship, and Ι ran towards it and climbed
up its side. In it were almost all those of gentle birth, crowded together
and terrified, seeking refuge from the furies. I prayed that we might
have a favourable voyage. The ship left the shore, but my hopes were
vain: the sky grew dark and the winds lashed the waves into storm,
the ship was driven before thern amid thunder and rain. There was
confusion among the sailors, and the captain in vain endeavoured to
direct the ship’s course.

CAP. XVIII. At length the storm so increased that all were in
despair of safety. A huge monster of the sea, Scylla and Charybdis
both in one, appeared as if to destroy the ship and all who were in it.
We prayed to heaven for help.

(The Tower of London was like this ship, shaken by the storm, its
walls giving way to the fury of the mob. In vain it offered hopes of
safety3 it was stained with foul parricide, and the den of the leopard
was captured by assault.)

When I saw these things I was terrified in my sleep‚ and I prayed
to God for help. ‘Thou Creator and Redeemer of the human race,
thou who didst save Paul from the sea, Peter from prison and Jonah

from the whale’s belly‚ hear my prayer, Ι entreat thee. Help me and
grant that I may be cast up on a favourable shore l’

As I prayed, the monster struck the ship, and it was almost swallowed
up by the fury of Scylla.

CAP. XIX. Yet our eries and tears were not unheard. When the
storm raged most furiously, there was one William, a Mayor, who was
moved to high deeds: he struck down that proud Jay, and with his
death the storm abated, Scylla restored its prey, and the ship once
more rode upright upon the water. The sailors regained their courage
and hoisted a little sail‚ peace returned and the sky became clear.
Ι· then with all the rest gave thanks to Christ.

CAP. XX. Still my dream went on, and still I seemed to see that
ship, which now with broken oars was drifting in search of a landing-
place. It was driven to that port where all this evil raged; it had
escaped Scylla, but it carne to an Island more dangerous than Scylla.
I landed, and asked one of those whom 1 met, ‘What island is this,
and why is there so great a concourse of people here ? ’ He replied :
‘ This is called the Island of Brute, and the men who dwell here are of
fair form but of savage condition. This people lays law and justice
