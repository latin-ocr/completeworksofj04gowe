CAP. 11. O thou who art called Fortune, why dost thou thus depress
those whom thou didst once exalt? Once our country was everywhere
honoured, all desired to be at peace with it: now our glory has departed
and enemies attack us from all quarters. Reply, F ortune, and say if
thou art the cause of this change. I think not, for Ι believe in God
and not in Fortune 3 yet I will describe thee, as rnen think that thou art.

CAP. ΙΙΙ. Fortune, hear what men say of thee, that thou hast a
double face, and goest by double paths, that nothing in thee is stable or
secure. No gifts may keep thee faithful, thou art lighter than the
dead leaves which fly before the wind: now thou art bright and fair,
now dark and lowering3 thy love is more treacherous than that of
a harlot, the prosperity which thou givest is very near to disaster.

CAP. IV. Fortune gives no honey without gall, she changes like
the sphere of the moon. Her wheel is ever turning, and no tears or
prayers will move her. Citizen and husbandman, king and rustic, rich
and poor, all are alike to her. Ah! why was so much power given to
such a one as she is?

Thus men say, believing that Fortune can overthrow the decrees of
God, but in fact she is nothing, fate is nothing, chance has nothing to
do with the affairs of rnen. Each one makes for himself his own lot:
if the will is good, good fortune follows, if evil, it makes the fortune bad.
Virtue will lead you to the summit of the wheel, and vice will bring you
and your fortune down to the bottom.

CAP. V. God has said that the man who obeys his commands shall
prosper in wealth and peace: the very elements are subject to the
righteous man. Joshua caused the sun to stand still, Gregory stayed
the plague, Moses divided the sea, Elisha caused iron to swirn, the
three children were unhurt by the fire, the earth rose to give a seat to
Hilarius. Wild animals, too, serve the just man, witness Daniel,
Silvester, Moses and Jonah.

CAP. VI. Again, the elements war against sinners: so it was in
the case of the plague caused by David's sin, in the case of the
Sodomites, Korah, Dathan and Abiram, Lysias and others. The
wicked man cannot enjoy good fortune, nor can the good man be
deprived of it. It was guilt that caused the fall of Pharaoh and of
Saul, the death of Ahab and of Eli with his sons. The Jews always

conquered while they were obedient to God’s law, and were overcorne
when they transgressed it.

CAP. VII. It is God Omnipotent, the Three in One, who governs

. all things here. As fire, heat and motion are three things combined in

one, so the F ather, Son and Holy Spirit are three persons but one
Godhead.

CAP. VIII. Christ, the Son of the Father, became incarnate in

man, and yet remained what he was before, being less than the F ather
and yet equal to him, perfect Man and perfect God. As the frailty of
