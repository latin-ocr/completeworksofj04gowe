MANUSCRIPTS lxvii

occurs on f. 158 v0. and Kenelm Digby's device, ‘Vindica te tibi,
Kenelme Digby,’ on f. 1.

The text of D is of a mixed character. Sometimes, in company with
TH2, it reproduces the original form ofa passage, as i. 1029 ff., vi. cap. xviii
and xix, vii. 189 f.‚ 1409 ff„ 1454 ff., 1479 ff. In other places, as iii. 1 ff,
vi. 545, and elsewhere, the readings of D are those of the revised MSS. It
is peculiar in the addition after vi. 522, where eight lines are introduced
from the original text of the altered passage which follows at the end of the
chapter. The text os D generally is much less correct than that of the older
copies, and it is derived from a MS. which had lines missing here and there,
as indicated by the ‘ deficit versus in copia,¹ which occurs sometimes in the
margin. In the numbering of the chapters the Prologues of Libb. ii. and iii.
are reckoned as cap. i. in each case. The corrections and notes of the rubri-
cator are not always sound, and sometimes we find in the margin attempts
to improve the author’s metre, in a seventeenth-century hand, as ‘Et qui
pauca tenet¹ for ‘Qui tenet et pauca’ (ii. 70), ‘Causa tamen credo' for
‘Credo tamen causa' (ii. 84). Some of these late alterations have been
admitted (strange to say) into Mr. Coxe's text (e. g. ii. 70).

The book is made up of parchment and paper in equal proportions‚ the
outer and inner leaves os each quire being of parchment. Sixteen leaves of
paper have been inserted at the beginning and twelve at the end of the
book, easily distinguished by the water-mark and chain-lines from the paper
originally used in the book itself. Most of these are blank, but some have
writing, mostly in sixteenth-century hands. There are medical prescriptions
and cooking recipes in English, selections of gnomic and other passages from
the Vox mamantis, among which are the lines ‘Ad mundum mitto) &c.‚
which do not occur in the Digby text, four Latin lines on the merits of the
papal court beginning ‘ Pauperibus sua dat gratis,’ which when read back-
wards convey an opposite sense, the stanzas by Queen Elizabeth ‘The
dowte of future force (corr. foes) Exiles my presente ioye, And wytt me
warnes to shonne suche snares As threten myne annoye‘ (eight four-line
stanzas).
