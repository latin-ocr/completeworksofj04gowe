lx GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

are proved to be original copies, not only by the handwriting of
the text, which in each case is distinctly of the fourteenth century,
but also by the fact that they all have author’s corrections written
over erasure, and in several cases the same hand is recognizable
throughout. The original text of the Vox Clamantz's seems to be
written in one and the same hand in the All Souls and Glasgow
MSS. and this hand is also that of the lines supplied occasionally
in the margin of the Harleian: the hand in which the text of the
Crom'ca Trzpertita is written in the All Souls MS. appears also in
all the other three, and the same is the case with some of the
correctors' hands, as will be seen in the detailed accounts which
follow. Of the other manuscripts of the Vox Clamantz's two,
which are not themselves original copies, give the text in its first
(unrevised) form, the rest are more or less in agreement with the
revised text, but give it at second or third hand, with no alterations
made over erasure.
