VOX CLAMANTIS. ANALYSIS xxxv

trembled⁷ and my senses were disturbed like water. Ι reflected what
the cause might be of my sudden terror, and my mind wandered by
various pathS. The night went on, yet no sleep carne, and terror of
a coming evil oppressed¹ me. Thus I spent the hours of darkness, not
knowing what was approaching, seeing the past and fearing for the
suture; but at length, towards dawn, sleep came upon my weary eyes,
and I began to dream.

CAP. II. Methought I went out upon a Tuesday to gather flowers,
and 1 saw people in bands going abroad over the fields. Suddenly the
curse of God fell like lightning upon them, and they were changed into
the forms of beasts, various bands into various forms.

One band was changed into asses rebellious against the halter and
the burden, careering over the fields and demanding to be as horses ;
and these had also horns in the middle of their foreheads, which were
stained with blood 3 they were swift as leopards in their leap, and had
tails like that of a lion, yet the stolid asinine mind was in them still.
I stood in terror and could advance no further.

CAP. III. With thern came oxen, who refused any longer to be
subject to the yoke and who would no longer eat straW. These too
were in monstrous shape with feet like those of a bear and with the
tails of dragons; they breathed forth fire and smoke like the bulls of
Colchos. They devastated the fields and slew nien: the plough, the
rake and the mattock lay idle. ‘Ah me 1² 1 said, ‘the cultivation of
the fields will cease and famine will come upon us.²

CAP. IV. A third band I saw transformed into swine‚ furious and
possessed by the devil. They followed one another, hog and hogling,
boar and little pig, the sow and her companion, and there was no
swine—herd to keep them away from the corn-fields. They wandered
where they would, and the pig ravaged like a wolf.

One boar there was, whom Kent produced, such as the whole earth
might not match. Flame came from his mouth and eyes, his tusks
were like those of an elephant3 foam mixed with human blood flowed
over his flanks. He strikes down all those whom he· meets and none
can prevail against him ε no place except heaven is safe from his rage.
From the North comes another boar to meet him and to plan destruc-
tlon.

These boars were greater and more furious than that of Tegea or
that which Meleager hunted. They are not content with acorns for
their food or water for their drink3 they devour rich food in the city
and drink good wine, so that they lie in drunkenness as dead. They
despise the pig-stye and defile kings’ palaces with their filth: their
grunting is like the roaring of a lion.

CAP. V. A fourth band was turned into dogs, who are not content
with the food from their master's table, but range in search of better,
who do not hunt hares or stags, but bark at the heels of men. Here
