374 VOX CLAMANTIS

541. solent: see note on l. 492.
545. Coppa: used as a familiar name for a hen in the Speculum

Stultorum, pp. 55, 58, and evidently connected with ‘Coppen’ or
‘Coppe,' which is the name of one of Chantecleer’s daughters in the
Low—German and English Reyuard.

557 f. ‘They determine that days are lawful for those things for
which the dark form of night had often given furtive ways.'

568. quod: equivalent to ‘vt’; cp. 11. 600, 1610.

576. G reads ‘perstimulant’ with CED.

579 f. See Ovid, filetum. vi. 366 ff. Apparently ‘colonum’ is for
‘ colonorum.9

603. Toruus oester: cp. Speculum Stultorum, p. 25.

615 f. Cp. Speculum Stultorum, p. 24, l. 21 f.

(535. Cp. Speculum Stultorum, p. 25, l. 15.

637 f. Speculum Stultorum, p. 26,

‘Haec est illa dies qua nil nisi cauda iuvabit,
Vel loca quae musca tangere nulla potest.’

652. stramine: probably an allusion to the name of Jack Strawe, as
‘tegula ⁷ in the next couplet to Wat Tyler.

Cap. ix. Heading, 1. 3. It seems to be implied that the jay, which must
often have been kept as a cage-bird and taught to talk, was commonly
called ‘Wat,’ as the daw was called ‘Jack,' and this name together
with the bird’s faculty of speech has suggested the transformation
adopted for Wat Tyler.

716. There is no punctuation in S, but those MSS. which have
stops, as CD, punctuate after ‘nephas’ and ‘soluit.’ The line is
suggested by Ovid, Fasti, ii. 44, ‘Solve nefas, dixit3 solvit et ille
nefas.’ There it is quite intelligible, but here it is without any clear
meaning.

It may be observed here that the passage of Ovid in which this line
occurs, Fasti, ii. 35- 46, is evidently one of the sources of Confessio
Α mantis, v. 2547 ff.

749. Sicut arena maa-is: cp. Rev, xx. 8, to which reference is made
below, 11. 765 ff.

762. ‘All that they lay upon us, they equally bear themselves.’
Apparently this is the meaning, referring to the universal ruin which
is likely to ensue.

765-776. T hese twelve lines are taken with some alterations of
wording and order from Godfrey of Viterbo, Pantheon, p. 228 (ed. 1584).
In l. 765 the reference to the Apocalypse is to Rev. xx.

774. forum : apparently ‘ law?

783 ff. This well-known chapter was very incorrectly printed in the
Roxburghe edition, owing to the fact that a leaf has here been cut out
of S, and the editor followed D. Fuller, whose translation of the
opening lines has often been quoted, had a better text before him,
probably that of the Cotton MS.
