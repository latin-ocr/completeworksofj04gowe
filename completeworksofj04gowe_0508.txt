327 f. Cp. De Vita fllonaclzorum, p. 182,

‘Sic mihi, divitibus si quando defuit hostis;
Hos terit et quassat saepe ruina gravis.'

NVhere, it would seem, we ought to read ‘ Dic mihil

329 ff. De Vita Monaclzorum, p. 181. Most of the lines 329-348 are
borrowed.

351. ⁴ Nonne ’ for ‘ Num‚’ as often: cp. v. 731.

355 f. Cp. De Vita Alonaclzorum, p. 182,

‘Iustitiae montes virtutumque ardua nullus
Scandet‚ dum mundi rebus onustus erit!

357. De Vita lilonachornm, p. 190.

359-372. Most of these lines are borrowed with slight alterations
from De Vita M onaclzorum, p. 191.

387 ff. Cp. Mz'rour, 24733 ff.

389. Cp. De Vita Monaclwrum, p. 192, ‘Cur ampla aedificas
busto claudendus in arcto ? '

397. De Vita Monachorum, p. 193,

‘Et cecidit Babylon, cecidit quoque maxima Troia
Olim mundipotens, aspice, Roma iacet.'

419ff. Cp. le'rour, 24817—25176.

522. The insertion which is found after this line in the Digby MS.
(and in no other) consists of eight lines taken from the original text
of the passage 545-580, which was rewritten by the author: see
ll. 561*—566* and 579* f.

523ff. ‘Can a house be built without timber? But of what use is
timber to the builder if it be not hewn ?’ ‘Nonne' for ‘Num,' as
frequently: see note on v. 731. It seems that ‘sibi' refers to the
builder rather than to the house; in any case, it has no reflexive sense.
Finally‘ligna' is here used as a singular feminine: all the MSS. have
‘foret' inl. 524 and ‘valet ' in 525.

The idea of the passage seems to be that good laws are as the
material, and the ruler as the builder of the house.
