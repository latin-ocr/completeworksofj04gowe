LIFE OF GOWER xxiii

from which it would appear that we cannot depend even upon the
features of the effigy which now exists, as original.

The figures of the virgins were repainted in the course of the
seventeenth century apparently, for in Hatton’s New Vt'ew of
london (date 1708) they are described as appearing with ‘ducal
coronets¹.' In Rawlinson's Mztural Hi‘story and Antt'qus'tles of
Secrrey (published 1719) the effigy is spoken of as having a
‘scarlet gown,' the older descriptions‚ e. g. Stow, giVing it as ‘an
habit of purple damasked‚’ and it is said that there is upon the
head ‘ a chaplet or diadem of gold about an inch broad, on which
are set at equal distances four white quaterfoyleS.'² The writer

Later, in 1765, Tyler describes the gown as purple and the
arms as pendent by the dexter corner. The figures of women
have ducal coronets and scrolls of gold, and below them is the
epitaph ‘Armigeri scutum.' Under the statue the inscription
‘ Hic iacet‚’ διαὶ The monument, as here described, is engraved
in Gough's Sqmlclzral fllomcments (date 1796), where there is s
a full description of it ⁵. Blore, under whose direction the
position of the monument was changed, says in 1826 that the
inscription on the ledge of the tomb ‘Hic iacet‚' &C.‚ was then
entirely gone.

Dollman says that there was a fire which injured the nave of
the church in the reign of Richard II, and that the windows of the
