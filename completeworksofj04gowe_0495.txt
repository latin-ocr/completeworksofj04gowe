1113 f. Ovid, Ars Amat. iii. 595 f. (where we have ‘sequatur’).
The original application is to the effects of rivalry in stimulating the
passion of lovers. For the use of ‘sequetur' here, apparently as
a subjunctive, compare 1. 1946, ‘ Inueniet tardam ne sibi lentus opem.’

1118—1124. These lines are almost entirely borrowed from the
Aurora, (MS. Bodley 822) f. 21 v0.

1124. In the Glasgow MS. ‘ Est ' has been here altered to ‘Et.’
1145-1150. Almost verbatim from Aurora, f. 93 v0.

1169. S has here in the margin in a somewhat later hand than that
of the text, ‘ N ota hic quattuor neccessaria episcopo.
1171 f. Cp. Aurora, f. 44 v0,

‘Est olei natura triplex, lucet, cybat, unguit;
Hec tria mitratum debet habere capud.’

1183 f. Cp. Aurora, f. 44 v0‚

‘ Lux est exemplo, cibus est dum pascit egenos,
Vnctio dum populis dulcia vuerba ferit.’

Gower is right in reading ‘serit,' which is given in MS. Univ. Coll.
143, f. 13.

1206. Cp. 1. 1376.

1213. Cp. Ovid, Ars Amat. iii. 655.

1215 f. Cp. Ars Amat. iii. 653 f.

1233. Cp. Ars Amat. ii. 279.

1247 ff. Cp. Mirour, 18793 ff.

1267. Vox populi, διε. : cp. Speculum Stultorum, p. 100, l. 4, and see
also the note on iii. Prol. 11.

1271. Cp. Conf. Amantis, Prol. 304 ff. and Mz'rour‚ 18805.

1313. With the remainder of this Book, treating of the secular clergy,
we may compare Mz'rour de l'Omme, 20209—20832.

1341. Cp. lllirour, 18889ff.

1342. participaret, ‘he ought to share ’ z see note on l. 676.

1359 f. Cp. Conf. Amanlz’s, i. 1258ff.

1375 ff. Cp. lllirour, 20287 ff.

1376. The reading ‘vngat vt' is given by the Digby MS. and seems
almost necessary: cp. l. 1206.

1405. prece rzff . . et albi, ‘ by reason of the petition of the red and
the white,' that is, presumably, by the influence of gold and silver‚
‘ dominis' in the next line being in a loose kind of apposition to adative
case suggested by ‘Annuit.’

1407. S has here in the margin, in a rather later hand, ‘contra
rectores Oxonss

1417. Eccles. iv, 10, ‘Vae soli, quia cum ceciderit, non habet
sublevantem se.'

1432. The margin of S has here, in the same hand as at 1407,
‘ Nota rectores et studentes Oxon.'

1443. formalis, that is, ‘ eminent,' from ‘ sorma' meaning ‘rank' or

‘ dignity,' but here also opposed to ‘ materialis.’
