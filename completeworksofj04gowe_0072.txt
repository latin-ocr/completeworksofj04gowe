lxii GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

Fairfax 3, as well as in the substituted leaf at the beginning of the Confessio
Amanlis in that manuscript. It is also used sor the Cronica Triperlita, Traitie'
and other pieces in the Glasgow MS. (G), for the Cron. Tripertita and other
Latin pieces in H, and for some of the rewritten passages os the Vox Clamantis
in G, H, and C. The third (3)· is a rather rough hand, found also occasion-
ally in corrections ofGand H. The fourth (4) is that in which the same
marginal note is written also in C, H and G.

Parehment, ff. 132 in quires of eight leaves (except the first, which has

Vox Clamantis, then 52 or 51, regularly and well written with passages
erased and rewritten as in CH. On f. 6 νΟ is a painting like that in the
Cotton MS. of a man in a brown hat, a blue coat with brown lining,
and with three arrows in his belt, shooting an arrow at the globe
(which has a threefold division corresponding to the three elements of
air, earth, and water), with the lines ‘Ad mundum mitto mea iacula ’ δερ.
There is a floreated page at the beginning of Lib. i. (after the Prologue)
and illuminated initials with decoration at the beginning of the other
books3 large and small coloured capitals for chapters and paragraphs.

I have to thank Dr. Young the Librarian of the Hunterian Museum,
for facilities given to me in using this MS. and for his kind help in
collating and describing it.

The text os G has, as might be expected, a close affinity with that of S,
but the peculiarities of S as regards revision in certain passages, e. g. iii. 1 ff.‚
iv. 1197 ff.‚ are not shared by this MS., which goes here with the other revised
copies, C and H. In one place at least G has a further touch of revision,
viz. in the heading of vi. cap. vii., where its reading is shared by D. In a
good many instances, however, G stands with S (sometimes in company with
D or L> in support of a probably true reading which is not given by other
MSS.‚ as i. 465, 468, 979, 1454, iv. 72, v. 789, vii. 684, 1342, or of an error,
as i. 1525, 1870, iii. 1863, iv. 799. It may be noted that sometimes in G an
erasure has been made without the correction being supplied.

The following are some of the hands that may be distinguished in this
manuscript:
