384 VOX CLAMANTIS

425 ff. Cp. Aurora, (MS. Bodley 822) f. 103,

‘ Cogitat inde domum domino fundare, sed audit
A domino, “Templi non fabricator eris.

Es uir sanguineus, ideo templum mihi dignum
Non fabricare potes, filius inuno tuus.”
Sanguineus uir signat eum qui, crimina carnis ”
Amplectens‚ templum non ualet esse dei.
Ecclesie sancte talis non erigit edem,

Nec sacre fidei collocat ille domum!

508. ‘And whosoever may sound trumpets, we ought to be silent⁷:
cp. i. 1609.

531 f. Aurora, f. 75 v0.

619 f. Ovid, Pont. ii. 5. 61 f.

623 f. Pont. ii. 6. 21 f.

641. See Ars Amat. ii. 417, where we find ‘semine‚’ a reading
which is required by the sense, but not given in the Gower MSS.

651. ‘ The line of descent by right of his mother proclaims Christ to
be heir of that land in which he was born.’ The author argues for
crusades to recover the Holy Land‚ if there must be wars, instead of
wars against fellow Christians‚ waged by one pope against the other
under the name of crusades ε cp. below, 945 ff.

676. quoforet ipse vigil, ‘ where it ought to be watchful‚’ a common
use of the imperfect subjunctive in our author’s Latin : cp. ‘gestaret,’
695, ‘ lederet‚' 922, ‘ medicaret‚’ 1052.

815. 'What follows is spoken as in the person of the supreme pontiff:
cp. Μίνων, 18505-18792, where somewhat similar avowals are put into

the mouth of a member of the Roman Court.
819 f. Cp. Conf. Amantz's, Prol. 261,

‘The hevene is ferr, the world is nyh.’

833. Ovid‚ Fasti, v. 209.

955 f. I take this concluding couplet as a remark made by the author
on the sentiments which he has just heard expressed by the represen-
tati've ofthe Pope. It practically means that ‘ Clemens ’ is not a proper
name for the Pope: it is in fact a ‘ headless name ’ and should rather
be ‘Inclemens.' Compare the address to Innocent 111 at the begin-
ning of Geoffrey de Vinsauf⁷s Poetrzzz Nova ε

‘Papa‚ stupor mundi, si dixero Papa nocenti,
Acephalum nomen tribuam tibi: si caput addam,
Hostis erit metri‚' ἃς.

957 ff. It seems best to take what follows as, in part at least,
a dialogue between the author and the representative of the pope, who
has just spoken. Soon however the speech passes again entirely to
the author. The Biblical reference here is to Revelation, xxii. 8f.
The same use is made of it in the Λίίνοιιν, 18736 ff.

1077-1080. These four lines are from the Aurora, f. 44 νο.
