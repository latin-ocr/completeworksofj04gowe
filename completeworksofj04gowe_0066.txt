lvi GOWER'S LATIN WORKS

CAP. XXII. The days are coming which Christ soretold, and the
signs which he predicted are visible nOW. God’s sentence is still
delayed, in order that the sinner may have room sor repentance.
Hardly even a few just men are found to save the world from destruc-
tion.

CAP. XXIII. Each one of the various degrees of society has
departed from its true virtue, and the deadly vices have rule over the
whole. Prelates are worldly, priests unchaste, scholars lazy, monks
envious and sels-indulgent, knights are evil livers, merchants defraud,
peasants are disobedient and proud. The enticements of the world
have overcome them all.

CAP. XXIV. I love all the realms of Christendom, but most of all
Ι love this land in which Ι was born. From other lands I stand apart
and arn not involved in their calamities ; but this country of mine, which
brought me up from childhood and in which Ι dwell, cannot suffer evil
without affecting me: by its burdens Ι am weighed d0wn; if it stands,

Ι stand, if it falls, Ι fall. Therefore it is that Ι bewail its present -

divisions.

One thing above all things is needfuI, and that is justice, with which is
associated peace. If in other lands the sins of the flesh prevail, yet
there they are to some extent compensated3 for there justice prevails
and all are equal before the law. Among us, however, not only is there

prepared for us by God.

We, who have always been favoured by fortune, are now brought
low ; this land, which was once reputed so wealthy, is now poor both
in virtue and in possessions ; my country, which was so strong, is made
feeble by unjust judgements ; she who was so fertile, is now sown with
salt; she who had Fame for her sister, is now infamous, all her praise
is taken away and her glory is departed. Her lords are sunk in sloth,
her clergy is dissolute, her cities full of discord, her laws oppressive
and without justice, her people discontented.

O land barren of virtue, where is thy past fortune? omens appear
which presage thy fate, and all point to thee as an example. It is not
by fortune or by chance that this comes about, but by our sins ; and
the grace of God even now may be found by repentance. I pray that
God may show us his mercy and accept our tears. W'e know that thou,
O God, art alone to be worshipped, that thou art the ruler of all things,
and not fortune. Show pity therefore, O God!

CAP. XXV. Such were the verses which came to me by inspiration
in my sleep. It is not Ι who speak thern, but the common voice of all.
Let him who feels himself in fault amend his ways, and he who seels
himself free from fault may pass untouched. I accuse no man; let
each examine his own conscience.

The world is neither evil nor good : each man may make of it what
