 

NOTES. CAPITULA—Lm. I. 40 371

43f. Cp. Ovid, Tristia, i. 5. 53 f.

47 f. Cp. Pons. iv. 2. 19, where the comparison to a spring choked
with mud is more clearly brought out. ,

49. The original reading here was ‘ confract0,’ but it has been altered
to ‘contracto ’ in C and G, while E gives ‘ contracto ’ from the first hand.
The general meaning seems to be that as the long pilgrimage to Rome
is to one with crippled knee‚ so is this work to the author, with his
limited powers of intellect.

56. The reading ‘conturbant’ in all the best MSS. seems to be
a mistake.

57 f. The author is about to denounce the evils of the world and
proclaim the woes which are to follow, like the writer of the Apocalypse,
whose name he bears. Perhaps he may also have some thought of the
formula ‘seint John to borwe’ by which travellers committed them-
selves to the protection of the saint on their setting forth: cp. Cous.
Amantis, v. 3416.

LIB. I.

1. The fourth year of Richard II is from June 22‚1380 to the same
date of 1381. The writer here speaks of the last month of that
regnal year, during which the Peasants’ rising occurred. .

4. Cp. Ovid, Her. xvii 112, ‘Praevius Aurorae Lucifer ortus erat.5

7f. Godfrey of Viterbo, Pantheon, p. 24 (ed. 1584), has

‘ Luce diem reparat, mirandaque lumina praestat,
Sic suga dat noctem, luxque reversa diem.²

He is speaking of the Sun generally, and the second line means
‘ Thus his departure produces the night and his returning light the
day.’ As introduced here this line is meaningless.

9. Adapted from Ovid, Metam. ii. 110.

11. Cp. Metam. vii. 703, but here ‘mane ’ is made into the object of
the verb instead of an adverb.

13. Cp. Metam. ii. 113.

15. Cp. flsetam. ii. 24.

17 f. From Godfrey of Viterbo, Pantheon, p. 24 (ed. 1584).

21 ff. Cp. Metam. ii. 107 ff„

‘Aureus axis erat, temo aureus, aurea summae
Curvatura rotae, radiorum argenteus ordo.

Per iuga chrysolithi positaeque ex ordine gemmae
Clara repercusso reddebant lumina Phoebo!

‘ alter ab auro' seems to mean ‘different from gold.'

27. Cp. Metam. ii. 23.

33-60. This passage is largely from Ovid: see especially Fasts,
i. 151 ff. and iii. 235-242‚ iv. 429 f.‚ v. 213f., Aselam. ii. 30, Tristia,
'ii. 12. -8.

l 40. 1511 Ovid (Fasti, iii. 240) it is ‘ Fertilis occultas invenit herba vias!
