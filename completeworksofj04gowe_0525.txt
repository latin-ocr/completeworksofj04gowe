now earls of Huntingdon and Kent. Spenser is the former earl of
Gloucester.

417 f. Kent and Salisbury were put to death by the populace at
Cirencester, and Despenser at Bristol. The earl of Huntingdon was
captured and irregularly executed in EsseX. ⁴

432 ff. The statement here is not that Richard deliberately starved
himselfto death on hearing of the failure of the rising and the death of
his associates, but that lie-lost hope and courage and could not eat,
‘quod vix si prandia sumit, Aut si sponte bibit vinum,' and that he
desired the death which cameto him. This is not an incredible
account, and it is fairly in accordance with the best evidence. Most of
the contemporary authorities give starvation as the cause, or one of the
causes, of death, and the account of it given in our text agrees with
that of Walsingham (ii. 245), Annales Henricz‘l V, p. 330, Ezclog. Hisz‘.
contin. iii. 387. The Monk ovaesham mentions this commonly accepted
story, but thinks it more probable that he was starved involun-
tarily: ‘Aliter tamen dicitur et verius, quod ibidem fame miserabiliter
interiit,⁷ and this is also the assertion of the Percies’ proclamation
(Harding’s Chronicle, ed. Ellis, p. 352). Creton says,

‘Apres le roy de ces nouvelles,

Qui ne furent bonnes ne belles,

En son cuer print de courroux tant,
Que depuis celle heure en avant
Oncques ne menga ne ne but,

Ains covint que la mort recut,
Comme ilz dient; maiz vrayement
Je ne croy pas ensement:'

and he proceeds to say that he rather believes that Richard is still alive
in prison (Archaeologia, xx. p. 408). Adam of Usk (p. 41) says that
Richard was brought almost to death by grief and the disappointment
of his hopes, but that his death was partly caused by the scantiness of
the food supplied to him. The Chronique de la Trcti‘son tells the
story about Piers Exton, which was afterwards commonly accepted
by historians, but this was certainly not current at the time in
England.

462 ff. The epithet ‘ pius,’ which Gower attaches to Henry's name in
this passage, means in his mouth ‘ merciful,' and in the margin the
‘ pietas ’ of the new king is contrasted with the ‘ cruelty ' of Richard,
the vice to which Gower chiefly attributes his fall. There is no doubt
that the execution of Arundel and the murder of Gloucester (or the
popular opinion that he had been murdered) produced a very sinister
impression, and caused a general feeling of insecurity which was very
favourable to Henry’s enterprise. It is true also that Henry showed
himself scrupulously moderate at first in his dealings with political
