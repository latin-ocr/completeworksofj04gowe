LIFE OF GOWER xi

High Rothing and elsewhere, fished in his fishery and assaulted
his servants¹3 John Gower mentioned in connexion with the
parishes of Throwley and Stalesfield‚ Kent, in 1381—223 John
Gower who was killed by Elias Tainour, apparently in 1385³;
John Gower who was appointed with others in 1386 to receive
and distribute the stores at Dover Cast1e⁴ 3 none of whom can
reasonably be identified with the poet. Therefore it cannot be
truly said, as it is said by Pauli, that the surname Gower, or even
the combination John Gower, is a very uncommon one in the
records of the county of Kent ⁵.

Before proceeding further, it may be well to set forth in order
certain business transactions recorded in the reign of Edward III,

in which a certain John Gower was concerned, who is identified by
Nicolas with the poetss.

They are as follows :—

39 Ed. III (1365). An inquiry whether it will be to the
prejudice of the king to put John Gower in possession of half
the manor of Aldyngton in Kent, acquired by him without licence
of the king from William de Septvans, and if so, ‘ad quod
damnum) This half of Aldyngton is held of the king by the
service of paying fourteen shillings a year to the Warden of
Rochester Castle on St. Andrew’s day ⁷.

⁴ Rot. Pat. dated Aug. 12, Dec. 23, 1386.

⁵ It may here be noted that the poet apparently pronounced his name
⁴ Gower‚’ in two syllables with accent on the second, as in the Dedication to
the Bakrdes, i. 3, ‘Vostre Gower, q’est trestout vos soubgitz.' The final
syllable bears the rhyme in two passages of the Confessio Ama-tntis (viii. 2320,
2908), rhyrning with the latter syllables of ‘pouer' and ‘ reposer'. <The
rhyme in viii. 2320, ‘Gower z pouer‚’ is not adissyllabic one, as is assumed in
the Dict. os Nat. Bz'ogr. and elsewhere, but os the final syllables only.) In
the Praise os Pence, 373, ‘ 1, Gower, which am al the liege man,' an almost
literal translation of the French above quoted, the accent is thrown rather
on the first syllable.

Sir H. Nicolas cites the Close Rolls always at second hand and the Inquisi-
tiones Post Mortem only from the Calendar, Hence the purport of the
documents is sometimes incorrectly or insufficiently given by him. In
the statement here following every document is cited from the original, and the
inaccuracies of previous writers are corrected, but for the most part silently.

⁷ Inquis. Post Mortem, ἃς. 39 Ed. ΙΙΙ. 36 (and number). This is in fact an
‘Inquisitio ad quod damnum.' The two classes of Inquisitions are given
without distinction in the Calendar, and the fact leads to such statements as
