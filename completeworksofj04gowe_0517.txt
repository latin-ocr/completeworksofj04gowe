the king to take strong measures against Warwick (Malverne‚
p. 105).

109. depuleo ΛῙῖσΙιαείἰε, ‘of Michael de la ΡοοΙ.’ The same view
of the meaning of the name is taken in Shakspere, 2 Henry VJ, iv.
1. 70, by the murderer of William‚ duke of Suffolk, son of this Michael,
‘ Pole, Pool, sir Pool, lord l Ay, kenneL puddle, sink.'

111 ff. This is Thomas Rushook, a Dominican, who was translated
from Llandaff to Chichester by the king's special desire in 1385. He
had incurred much suspicion and odium as the king's confessor and
supposed private adviser. Walsingham says, ‘ipse sibi conscius fugam
iniit’ (ii. 172); but he certainly appeared at the bar of Parliament
and was sentenced to forfeiture of his goods (Rot. Parl. iii. 241, Mal-
verne, p. 156).

113. ater: alluding to his Dominican habit.

121 ff. Cp. Knighton‚ ii. 255 f. All the five Appellants seem to have
entered the Tower‚ but the three spoken of here are of course the three
leaders, referred to in l. 41 and afterwards. Knighton says that the
king invited the five to stay for the night, but only the earls of Derby
and Nottingham accepted the invitation. The fact that Gower here
assigns no political action to his hero the earl of Derby (who was under
twenty years old), but gives all the credit to the three leaders, shows
clearly that the young Henry played a very subordinate part.

131. commta: that is, ‘co-unata,’ meaning ‘assembled.'

133 ff. Cp. Knighton‚ ii. 292.

141. senecta. Burley was then fifty-six years old.

142. This evidently means that the queen interceded for him; cp.
Chronique de la Trai'mn, p. 9. Walsingham tells us only that the earl
of Derby tried to save Simon Burley and quarrelled with his uncle Glou-
cester on the subject. Burley had been the principal negotiator of the
marriage of Richard with Anne of Bohemia.

150. Walsingham says of him that he was ‘ab antiquo fallax et
fraudulentus!

152. Pons Aquilonis, ‘Bridgenorth.' Beauchamp was keeper of
Bridgenorth Castle (leot. Pat„ 10 Rich. ΙΙ. pt. 2. m. 15), but it does
not appear from other sources that he had the title here given him by
Gower of ‘baron Bridgenorth.’ In 1387 he was made a peer by patent
(the first instance of this) under the title of lord Beauchamp of Kidder-
minster.

154. Tribulus: i.e. Nicholas Brembel (so called by Gower), called
Brembul or Brembyl by Knighton, Brambre by Walsingham and Brembre
or de Brembre in the Patent Rolls and Rolls of Parliament. Pre-
sumably he was of Brembre (Bramber), in the county of Sussex. He had
been Mayor of London last in 1386. Knighton says of him ‘quem
saepius rex fecerat maiorem praeter et contra voluntatem multorum
ciuium’ (ii. 272), and Walsingham declares that he had planned a
proscription of his opponents, with a view to making himself absolute
ruler of London with the title of duke (ii. 174),
