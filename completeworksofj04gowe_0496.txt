386 VOX CLAMANTIS

1454. Originally the line was ‘Dum legit, inde magis fit sibi sensus
hebes,' but this was altered to ‘plus sibi sensus hebes est,⁷ with the
idea apparently of taking ‘magis ' with ‘legit.’ This involves an
awkward metrical licence, ‘hebes est’ equivalent to ‘ hebest‚' and the
original text stands in CEH as well as in TH2. The expedient of the
Roxburghe editor is quite inexcusable.

1493 ff. Cp. Asirour, 20314. The sporting parson was quite a
recognized figure in the sourteenth century. Readers of Froissart
will remember how when the capture of Terry in Albigeois was effected
by stratagem, the blowing of the horn to summon the company in
ambush was attributed by those at the gate to a priest going out into
the fields, ⁴ Ah that is true, it was sir Francis our priest; gladly he goeth
a mornings to seek for an hare.’

1498. sugat: used apparently as subjunctive also in l. 2078, but it is
possible that ‘ Nec fugat ' may be the true reading here.

1509 ff. Cp. Mz'rour de l’Omme, 20313 ff.

1527. Est sibi missa, ‘his mass is over!

1546. Apparently a proverbial expression used of wasting valuable
things.

1549. If benefices went from father to son, little or nothing would be
gained by those who go to Rome to seek preferment‚ for an heir would
seldom fail.

1555 ff. Cp. lllirour de l'Omme, 20497 ff. The priests here spoken of
are the ‘annuelers‚' who get their living by singing masses for the dead,
the ⁴ Annua seruicia ’ spoken of below:

‘Et si n'ont autre benefice,
Chantont par auns et par quartiers
Pour la gent mort.' Λίίνοιιν, 20499.

1559. In the lllz'rour,
‘Plus que ne firont quatre aingois ’ (20527).

1587-1590. Taken with slight change from Aurora, (MS. Bodley 822)
Ο
f. 6155531. ‘With the ancients it is possible to say ‘⁴ hic et hec sacerdos‚‘⁷ '

that is, ‘ sacerdos ' is both masculine and feminine.
1693-1700. Adapted from Aurora, f. 65,

‘Omen in urbe malum bubo solis iubar odit,
Escam uestigat nocte, ueretur aues:

In quem forte gregis auium si lumina figant,
Et clamando uolant et laniando secant.
Incestus notat iste reos, qui corpore sedi
Contra nature iura latenter agunt:

Hos iusti quasi lucis aues discerpere querunt,
Zelo succensi uerba seuera serunt.'

(‘ Conclamando ' for ‘ Et clamando ’ in MS. Univ. Coll. 143.)
1727 ff. Cp. Μίνοιιν, 20713 ff.
