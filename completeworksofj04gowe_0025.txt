LIFE OF GOWER xv

irregularly acquired in 1365, and possibly with this may be
connected a payment by John Gower of ³§20 at Michaelmas
in the year 1368 to Richard de Ravensere ¹, who seems to have
been keeper of the hanaper in Chancery.

It is impossible without further proof to assume that the
villainous misleader of youth who is described to us in the report
of the above commission, as encouraging a young man to defraud
the Crown by means of perjury, in order that he may purchase
his lands from him at a nominal price, can be identical with the
grave moralist of the Speculum Hmm'm's and the Vox Clamanll’s.
Gower humbly confesses that he has been a great sinner, but he
does not speak in the tone of a converted libertine: we cannot
reconcile our idea of him with the proceedings of the disreputable
character who for his own ends encouraged the young william
Septvans in his dishonesty and extravagance. The two men
apparently bore the same arms, and therefore they belonged to
the same family, but beyond this we cannot go. It may be
observed moreover that the picture suggested to Prof. Morley
by the deed of 1373, executed at Otford‚ of the poet’s residence
in the pleasant valley of the Darent‚ which he describes at some
length ², must in any case be dismissed as baseless. Otford was
a manor held by Sir John Cobhamss, and whether the John
Gower of this deed be the poet or no, it is pretty clear that the
deed in question was executed there principally for this reason,
and not because it was the residence of John Gower.

Dismissing all the above records as of doubtful relevancy to
our subject ⁴², we proceed to take note of some which seem actually
to refer to the poet. Of these none are earlier than the reign
of Richard ΙΙ. They are as follows:

1 Ric. II. (May, 1378). A record that Geoffrey Chaucer has
given general power of attorney to John Gower and Richard

¹ Rot. Claus. 42 Ed. 111. m. 13 d.

² English Witers, vol. iv. pp. 150 ff.

³ See Calendar os Post Mortem Inquzkitffins, vol. ii. pp. 300, 302.

⁴ So also the deeds of 1 Ric. 11 releasing lands to Sir J. Frebody and John
Gower (Hasted's Histovy ofKent, iii. 425), and 0f4 Ric. 11 in which Isabella
daughter of Walter de Huntyngfeld gives up to John Gower and John Bow-
land all her rights in the parishes of Throwley and Stalesfieldy Kent (Rot.
Claus. 4 Ric. 11. m. 15 d), and again another in which the same lady remits to
John Gower all actions, plaints, δίο, which may have arisen between them
(Rot. Claus. 8 Ric. 11. m. 5 d).
