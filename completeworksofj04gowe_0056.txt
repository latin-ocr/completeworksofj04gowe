xlvi· GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

LIBER QUARTUS,

CAP. I. Men of Religious Orders are also of various conditions‚ some
good and others bad. Let each bear his own hurden of blame 2 I write
only what common report tells me.

There are first those who hold temporal possessions‚ and some of
these live in gluttony and luxury.

CAP. 11. Those who leave the world should give up worldly things ;
but in these days the monk is known only by his garb. He indulges
himself with the richest food and the choicest drink, he makes haste
when the bell rings for a meal, but he rises very slowly and reluctantly
for midnight prayer. The monks of old were different; they dwelt in
caves and had no luxurious halls or kitchens, they were clothed in skins,
fed on herbs and drank water, and abstained from fleshly lusts. These
men truly renounced the world, but that blessed state has now perished.

have taken their places.

CAP. VIII. So also the regular Canons for the most part neglect
their monastic rule and have only a show of sanctity.

CAP. IX. Monks who are untrue to their profession are of all men
the most unhappy. - They have no real enjoyment of this world and
they lose also the joys of heaven.

CAP. X. Let all members of religious orders perform their vows
and repent of their past sins, of their pride, luxury, avarice, ambition,
gluttony, wrath, envy and strife.

CAP. XI. Above all let them avoid intercourse with women, who
bring death to their souls. Let them labour and study3 for idleness
is the great incentive to evil.

CAP. XII. The monk who sets himself to observe his rule will live
hardly and fast often, praying continually and doing penanee for sin.
He will submit himself humbly to his prior, and he will not grudge to
