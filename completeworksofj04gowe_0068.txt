lviii GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

Some reference ought perhaps to be made in conclusion to the
list of Gower's works given by Bale and copied by others, with
a view to the question whether he was acquainted with any works
of Gower which are not known to us. In his Scriptorum Illu-
strium Catalaqus, p. 524 (ed. 1559) he says that Gower wrote

‘ Speculum Meditantzzv, Gallice, Lib. 10.

‘ Cmgfessiouem A mantis, Anglice, Lib. 8, ‘⁴ Eorum qui ante nos
scripserunt.”

‘ Vocem Clmmmffs, Latine, Lib. 7, ‘⁴ Scripture veteris capiunt
exempla.’'

‘ De cmnpunclz'one cordis, Lib. Ι.

‘ Chrom'con Rz‘cardz· Secundi, Lib. 3, “Opus humanum est inquirere.’⁷

⁴ Chrom'con impertitum, Lib. 3, ‘⁶ Tolle caput mundi C. ter et sex.’'

⁴ Ad Hem-scum quartum, Lib. Ι, “ Nobilis ac digne rex Henrice.''

‘ De eodem rege Henrico, Lib. 1, ‘⁶ Rex celi deus et dominus.'’

⁴ De peste vitiorum, Lib. Ι, ‘⁴ Non excusatur qui verum non fateatur.⁷’

‘ scrutinium lucis, Lib. 1, “ Heu quia per crebras humus est.’'

‘ De coniugii degustate, Lib. 1, “ Qualiter creator omnium rerum
Deus.'’

‘ De regimine principum, “O deus immense, sub quo dominatur.’'

‘ Epzjgrammata quaedam, Lib. 1, “Alta petens aquila volat alitque.’'

‘ De amoris vav-iescae, Lib. Ι, “ Est amor in glosa pax bellica.''

‘ C arms'mz diuersa, Lib. Ι, et alia plura!

In regard to this list it may be observed first that in the two
cases where the beginning of the book or piece in question is not
cited, we may safely assume that Bale had not seen it. This
applies to the Speculmn Asedilantz's and the supposed piece De
compunctione cordis, of which I can give no account. It will be
observed that he makes the short prose preface to the Cronica
Trz‘pertita, ‘Opus humanum est inquirere' &c.‚ into a separate
work in three books. The other items are all recognizable, ex-
cept ‘Epigrammata quaedam, Lib. 1, “Alta petens aquila volat
alitque.’'’ Here we may observe that the quotation is from Vox
Clamantis vi. 985, ‘Alta petens aquila volat alite celsius omni‚'
&o (a passage taken from the Aurora) 3 and on referring to Bale's
unpublished papers¹ we find the description of this supposed
book of epigrams in the following form, ‘ Ex suo libro et sancti-
fidensi chron. Epigrammata edidit, li. 1, ‘⁴ Alta petens aquila volat
alite‚'⁷'whence we should gather that the book referred to was
a collection of quotations. It is probable that Bale may have
