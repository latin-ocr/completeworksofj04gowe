410 CRONICA TRIPERTITA

while here to observe that Adam of Usk must certainly be regarded as
a first-hand authority and his account as a contemporary one. It has
usually been assumed that, though he says himself that he was present
at the parliament (‘ In quo parliemento omni die presensium compila-
tor interfuit ⁵), he actually borrowed his account of it from the Monk of
Evesham. This assumption rests entirely on the statement of the editor
of Adam of Usk's Chronicle‚ that he must have written later than 1415, a
statement which is repeated without question by Potthast‚ Gross, and
others. It may be observed‚ however, that the evidence adduced for
this late date is absolutely worthless. It is alleged first that Adam of
Usk near the beginning of his Chronicle alludes to the Lollard rising
in Henry V's reign, whereas what he actually says is that the Lollards
planned an attack on Convocaffion, but were deterred by the resolute
measures of the archbishop of Canterbury, at the time of the second
parliament of Henry IV, that is the year 1401, when Convocation was
engaged in an endeavour to suppress the Lollards and the archbishop
procured the execution of William Sawtree3 secondly we are told that
the chronicler refers (p. 55) to the death of the dauphin Louis, which
happened in 1415, whereas actually his reference is obviously to the
death of the dauphin Charles, which took place at the beginning of the
year 1402. Mr. James Tait in the Dict. ofNalz'onal Biography, vol. xlviii.
p. 157, has already indicated that an earlier date than 1415 is necessary,
by his reference to p. 21 of the Chronicle, where the chronicler speaks
of Edmund 6311 of March as a boy not yet arrived at puberty‚ which
points to a date not later than 1405. It seems probable that the Monk
of Evesham had before him Adam ostk’sjournal of the parliament of
1397, to which he made some slight additions from other 50111665, intro·
ducing into his account a political colour rather more favourable fo
Richard II. The close correspondence between them is confined to
the proceedings of this parliament at W'estminster. It may be added
that the account given by Adam of Usk is full of graphic details
which suggest an eye-witness.

129. The pardon pleaded by the earl of Arundel had already been
revoked by parliament‚ therefore the plea was not accepted. From
the attempts made by the king to recover Arundel's charter of pardon,
even after his execution (leot. Claus. 21 Ric. 11. pt. 2, m. 18 d.)‚ we may

perhaps gather that some scruples were felt about the revocation
of it.

tenance from the forfeited revenues, and that this promise was not
