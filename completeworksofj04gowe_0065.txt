he who uttered furious words, now cannot make a sound ; he who ter-
rified others by his threats, now does not scare away the worm which
eats his heart.

CAP. XII. What can avarice do for him who has served her? He
has no chest but his coffin, no land but the seven feet of earth in which
he lies. ,He who preyed upon others, is himself the prey of death3 he
who closed his purse against the poor, is now himself in want.

CAP. XIII. The slothful man who was given to sleep‚ has now
abundance of it, with the cold earth instead of his soft bed—coverings.
He who seldom came to the church, now never leaves it, but his time
for prayer is past.

CAP. XIV. Gluttony is no longer a pleasure; the body which de-
lighted in choice food and drink is now full of vileness and horror, the
abode of foul reptiles.

CAP. XV. The man who took pleasure in lechery‚ delights in it
now no more. His members are preyed upon by the serpent, and he
can no longer use his hands, his eyes, or his tongue in the service of lust.
No longer can he commit incest or violate the honour of virginity.

CAP. XVI. Answer, thou sinful man, what will thy pride do for thee
then, thy envy, thy anger, thy sloth‚ thy gluttony, thy lechery, or thy
avarice? All the glory of this world perishes and passes away.

CAP. XVII. Everything passes away, wealth, honour, beauty‚
power, learning, and pleasure. Our flesh grows old as a garment and
we perish. He is happy and a true king who rules himself, he is a slave
(though called a king) who is subject to his own vices. Our life is so
short and death comes so soon, that we ought all to prepare for our
journey hence. Death comes when we least expect it, and takes away
our wealth and strength, nor can any man redeem himself with gold,
or move with gifts the Judge who judges all things justly.

CAP. XVIII. Death is common to all, but to the good it is a cause
of joy, to the evil of sorrow. The good will pass by means of death to
a place of perfect peace and perfectjoy, such as cannot be described or
imagined.

CAP. XIX. The evil-doer has a twofold death, the death of the
body and th'e death of the soul. No words can tell the torment of that
second death, which is eternal. How terrible will the Judgement be
and how direful the sentence 1 Happy are they who shall escape such
punishment.

CAP. XX. Let each man remember what his condition is, and let
him repent in time, turning himself to the service of his Creator. Let
him submit to punishment in this life, that he may escape that which
is eternal : for it is the property of God to forgive and to have mercy.

CAP. XXI. Almost everyone, however, follows the lusts of his flesh
and neglects the cause of his soul. The unrighteous have power every-
where, and all vices flourish.
