VOX CLAMANTIS xxxi

‘Secundus enim liber sermone Latino versibus exametri et
pentametri compositus tractat super illo mirabili euentu, qui in
Anglia tempore domini Regis Ricardi secundi anno regni sui
quarto contigit, quando seruiles rustici impetuose contra nobiles
et ingenuos regni insurrexerunt. Innocenciam tamen dicti
domini Regis tunc minoris etatis causa inde excusabilem
pronuncians, culpas aliunde, ex quibus et non a fortuna talia
inter homines contingunt enormia, euidencius declarat. Titu-
lusque voluminis huius, cuius ordo septem continet paginas, Vox
Clamantis nominatur.'

So the statement of contents ran in its earlier form. After-
wards the excuses made for the king on the ground of his youth
were withdrawn, and in the final form of the statement the events
of the cronica Trzpertita are brought into the reckoning, and the
sall of Richard seems to be represented as a moral consequence
of the earlier missortunes of his reign.

Evidently what is quoted above is a very insufficient summary
of the Vox Clamantis, which in fact deals with the Peasants' rising
only in its first book5 and notwithstanding the fact that this event
so much overshadows the other subjects of the poem that the
author in describing his work afterwards treated it as the only theme,
there is some reason to question whether what we have is really
the original form of the poem, and even to conclude that the work
may have been originally composed altogether without this detailed
narrative of the insurrection. For this idea there is some manu-
script authority. It has not hitherto been noted that in one copy
(MS. Laud 719) the Vox Clamantls appears with the omission of
the whole of the first book aster the Prologue and first chapter ¹.
At the same time the text of this manuscript seems to be complete
in itself‚ and the books are numbered in accordance with the
omission, so that there are six booksonly, our second book being
numbered as the first ². There is really something to be said for

¹ The Lincoln MS. has the same feature, but it is evidently copied from
Laud 719.

² There seems also to have been an alternative numbering‚ which proceeded
on the principle of making five books, beginning with the thirdy the second
being treated as a general prologue to the whole poem. In connexion with
this we may take the special invocation os divine assistance in the prologue
of the third book, which ends with the couplet,

‘His tibi libatis nouus intro nauta profundum,
Sacrum pneuma rogans vt mea vela regaS.'
