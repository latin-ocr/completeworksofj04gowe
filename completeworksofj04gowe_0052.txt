the first Adam brought evil upon us all, so the strength of the second
Adam healed our wound and restored our fallen state.

CAP. IX. We must submit our mind to the faith‚ for man cannot
understand the things of God, and we must not examine too closely
the mystery which we cannot penetrate. This we know, that life
is given to all through the name of Jesus Christ.

CAP. X. The heathen bows down to figures of wood and stone,
asking help from that which his hands have made. VVas not the
world made for man and all things placed in subjection to him ? How
then can these idols be of any avail? Ι

As for us, we use images differently, not giving to them the worship
that belongs to God, but by thern assisting devotion; especially the

despoiled hell of its prey and ascended into heaven.

CAP. XI. God created the heaven and the earth, and all created

them continually, and he gives his gifts according to men’s merit.
WVhatever comes to pass in the world, whether it be good or evil, we
are the cause of it.

CAP. Ι. The order of the world is in three degrees‚—-Clergy, Knight-
hood and Peasantry. 1 shall deal first with the prelates of the
Church, whose practice is very far removed from the example of
Christ. Riches alone are valued by them, and the poor man is
despised, whatever may be his merits.

CAP. 11. Prelates of the Church are now hirelings‚ whose desire is
to live in luxury and to indulge their appetites. Gluttony and lust
everywhere prevail.

CAP. III. The prelates of the Church aim at earthly honours
instead of heavenly: they desire rather to have the pre-eminence than
