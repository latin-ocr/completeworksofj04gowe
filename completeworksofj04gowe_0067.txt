he will by his own life. ¹ But this I say, that sin committed and not
purged by repentance receives at length its due reward.

The conclusion of the Vox Clamantz‘s, as altered from the first
version, is doubtless intended as a fitting form of introduction for
the Crom'ca Trzpertita, which comes in as an appendix added in
later years. It will be noted as regards the prose which forms
a transition to this, that Gower has in the end brought himself to
think that the missortunes of the earlier part of Richard's reign
were intended as a special warning to the youthful king, whom he
formerly relieved from responsibility on account of his tendet age,
and that the tyranny of his later time sprang naturally out of
his disregard of this preliminary chastisement. This change of
view is also to be traced in the successive forms assumed by the
paragraph relating to the Vox clamantis in the author’s account
of his books (‘ Quia vnusquisque‚' ἃς..)

Of the contents of the Cronia-a T ripertita it is unnecessary that
more should be said than is contained in the Notes to this edition.
Of the remaining pieces the Carmen super nmltl'plici [siclorum
pestilencia is dated by the author as belonging to the twentieth
year of Richard II. The Traclalus de Lucis Scrutimb is probably
somewhat later, and the poem ‘O deus immense,' &c., is said in
one of the titles prefixed to have been composed near the end of
Richard’s reign. Besides these there is a group of Latin poems
referring to the accession of Henry IV, ‘Rex celi, deus,’ &c
adapted from the Vox Clamarem, ‘H. aquile pullus‚' and ‘O reco-
lende, bone,⁷ with several short occasional pieces belonging to the
last years of the author's life. One of these has reference to his
blindness and to the end of his activity as an author which was
caused by it, and in connexion with this we have also the epistle
to Archbishop Arundel prefixed to the All Souls MS. of the Vox
Clamanlis and other Latin poems, and apparently meant to
accompany the presentation of this particular copy. To Arundel
also is addressed the short piece referring to the comet of March
1402, and finally we have the lines in which allusion is made to
the short-comings of executors. It is probable also that the
four lines which afterwards appeared upon the poet's tomb,
‘Armigeri scutum‚’ δια, and which are given by the Glasgow MS„
were written by Gower himself.

¹ In the first version, ‘I arn myself the worst of sinners, but may God
grant me relies by his Spirit.'
