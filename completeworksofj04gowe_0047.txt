VOX CLAMANTIS. ANALYSIS xxxvii

the day in which the peasant shall drive out the lord; let honour, law
and virtue perish, and let our court rule.' They listen and approve,
and though they know not what ‘ our court ’ means, what he says has
for thern the force of law: if he says ‘strike,’ they strike, if he says
‘kill‚’ they kill. Their sound was as the sound of the sea, and from
terror I could scarcely move my feet. They strike a mutual compact
and declare that all those of gentle blood who remain in the world shall
be overthrown.

Then they advance all together3 a dark cloud mingled with the
furies of hell rains down evil into their hearts ; the earth is wetted with
the dew of the pit, so that no virtue can grOW, but every vice increases.
Satan is loose and among them, the princes of Erebus draw the world
after them, and the more Ι gaze, the more I am terrified, not knowing
what the end will be.

CAP. X. Furious rage there was, they were greedy for slaughter
like hungry wolves. The seven races derived from Cain were added
to them. The prophets spoke of them, Gog and Magog is their name,
they neither sear man nor worship God. Moreover those companions
of Ulysses, whom Circe transformed, are associated with them : some
have the heads of men and others of brute beasts.

CAP. XI. There is Wat, Tom and Sim, Bet and* Gib followed by
Hick; Coll, Geff and Will, Grigge, Dawe, Hobbe and Lorkin, Hudd,
Judd, Tebb and Jack, such are their names ; ¹ and Ball teaches them as
a prophet, himself having been taught by the devil.

Some bray like asses, others bellow like huns, they grunt, they bark,
they howl, the geese cackle, the wasps buzz ; the earth is terrified with
their sound and trembles at the name of the Jay.

CAP. XII. They appoint heralds and leaders, and they order that
all who do not favour them shall suffer death. They are armed with
stakes and poles, old bows and arrows, rusty sickles‚ mattocks and
forks 3 some have only clods and stones and branches of trees, They
wet the earth with the blood of their betters.

CAP. XIII. These come in their fury to the city of new Troy, which

¹ Fuller’s spirited translation of these lines is well known, but may here
be quoted again :

‘Tom comes thereat‚ when called by wat, and Simm as sorward we find,
Bet calls as quick to Gibb and to Hykk, that neither would tarry behind.
Gibb, a good whelp of that litter, doth help mad Coll more mischief to do,
And Will he does vow, the time is come now, he'll join in their company too.
Davie complains, whiles Grigg gets the gains, and Hobb with them does

partake,
Lorkin aloud in the midst of the crowd conceiveth as deep is his stake.
Hudde doth spoil whom Judde doth soil, and Tebb lends his helping hand,
But Jack the mad patch men and houses does snatch, and kills all at his
command.' Church History, Book iv. (p, 139).
