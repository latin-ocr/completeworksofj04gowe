1107-1112. De Vita lllonaclcorum‚ p. 193.

1115f. De Vita Asouacltornm, p. 183.

1159* ff. That this was the text which stood originally in S is proved
partly by the fact that the original heading of the chapter stands still
as given here in the Table of Chapters, f. 5, and also by the traces of
original coloured initials at ll. 1175 and 1199. A considerable part of
the erased chapter reappears in the poem ‘Rex celi deus,' &c., ad-
dressed to Henry IV: see p. 343.

1189 f. Si libi . . . cupias conuertere . . . Te. These words appear in
S as a correction of the rewritten text by a second erasure and in
another hand.

Cap. xix. Heading. The original form, as given by DLTH2‚ is still
to be found in the Table of Chapters in S.

1201. Cp. Ovid, Metam. vii. 585 f.‚

,ᾗ 1204 ff. Note the repeated use of ‘ modo ' in the sense of ‘ now ¹ : cp.

³) ‘formerly ' is ‘ nuper’; see 1241, 1245, 1279, &a
* 1205. Metam. ii. 541.

1223. Oea, that is Uzzah (2 Sam. vi.)‚ who is selected as a type of
,, carnal lust,apparently on the strength of the quite gratuitous assumption
ll adopted in Lib. III. 1885 ff. Apparently ‘luxus’ in the next line is
ll genitive, in spite of the metre ε cp. ‘excercitus,’ i. 609, ‘ ducatus,’ Crem.
Trip. iii. 117.
ἦ 1236. Gz‘esi, i. e. Gehazi.

demn Athanasius.

1251. degfzmctis, ⁴ for the dead, ' that is, to bury them charitably, as
Tobit did. ,

1261. Cp. John xii. 24.

as a new Jovinianus in a later poem, p. 347.

1273. Troianus: i.e. Trajan, whose name is so spelt regularly by our
