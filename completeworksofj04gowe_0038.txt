xxviii INTRODUCTION

on society are essentially the same as those of Wycliff, and con-
sidering also his strong opinions about the corruption of the
Church and the misdeeds of the friars, it is curious to find how
strongly he denounces the Lollards in his later writings.

He has a just abhorrence of war, and draws a very clear
distinction between the debased chivalry of his own day and the
true ideal of knighthood. Above all he has a deep sense of
religion, and is very familiar with the Bible. He strongly
believes in the moral government of the world by Providence,
and he feels sure, as others of his age did also, that the final
stage of corruption has almost come. Whatever others may
do, he at least intends to repent of his sins and prepare himself
to render a good account of his stewardship. In both his French
and his Latin work he shows himself a fearless rebuker of
evil, even in the highest places. The charge of time-serving
timidity has been sufficiently dealt with in the Introduction to
the English Works.

From the Vox clamantis it is evident that the rising of the
Peasants produced a very powerful, indeed almost an ovem-heiming,
impression upon his mind. He describes the terror inspired by
it among those of his social standing in the most impressive
manner. The progress of his political development during the
reign of Richard II is clearly seen in his Latin works, with their
successive revisions. He began, it is evident, with full hope
and confidence that the youthful king would be a worthy “
representative of his father the Black Prince, both in war and
in peace. As time goes on, and the boy develops into an ill-
regulated young man, under evil influences of various kinds, the
poet begins to have doubts, and these gradually increase until
they amount to certainty, and rebuke and denunciation take the
place of the former favourable anticipations. In the latest
version of the Confessio Amands, which is, no doubt, con-
temporary with some of these changes in the text of the Vox
Clamantz's‚ we see the author's confidence transferred from the
king to his cousin, not as yet regarded as a successor to the
throne, but thought of as representing a fair ideal of chivalry and
honesty. Finally, in the Crom'ca Trzpertz’ta, he accepts the fall
of Richard as the fatal consequence of a course of evil govern-
ment and treachery, and rejoices in the prospect of a new order
of things under his predestined hero.
