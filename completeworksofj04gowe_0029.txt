LIFE OF GOWER xix

more than one diocese of the province of Canterbury), by Agnes
the testator's wife, and administration of the property was granted
to her on N ov. 7 of the same year.

It may be observed with reference to this will that the testator
evidently stands already in the position of a considerable bene-
factor to the Priory of St. Mary Overey, in virtue of which
position he has his apartments in the Priory and a place of
honour assigned for his tomb in the church, He must also have
established by previous arrangement the daily mass and the
yearly obituary service which Berthelette speaks of as still
celebrated in his time. It is evident that his benefactions were
made chiefly in his life-time. There is some slight difficulty as
regards the manors which are mentioned in the will. Multon in
Suffolk we know already to have been in the poet's possession;
but what is this ‘Southwell'? Certainly not the well-known
Southwell in Nottinghamshire, which cannot possibly have been
in the possession of a private person, belonging, as it did, to the
archiepiscopal see of York. Moreover, though ‘in Comitatu
Nott.' has been hitherto printed as the reading of the will, the
manuscript has not this, but either ‘Notth.' or ‘North.‚’ more
probably the latter. There were apparently other manors of
Southwell or Suthwell in the county of Nottingham‚ and a manor
of Suwell in Northamptonshire, but there seems to be no con-
nexion with the name of Gower in the case of any of these. It is
possible, but not very readily to be assumed, that the scribe who
made the copy of the will in the register carelessly wrote ‘South—
well in Com. North.' (or ι(Ξοῐη. Notth.') for ‘Feltwell in Com.
Norff.,' the name which is found coupled with Multon in the
other records ¹.

The one remaining record is the tomb in St. Saviour’s church.
This originally stood in the chapel of St. John the Baptist‚ on the
north side of the church, but in 1832, the nave and north aisle
being in ruins, the monument was removed to the south transept
and restored at the expense of Earl Gower. After the restoration
of the church this tomb was moved back to the north aisle in

¹The remark of Nicolas about the omission of Kentwell from the will is
hardly appropriate. Even if Gower the poet were identical with the John
Gower who possessed Kentwell‚ this manor could not have been mentioned
in his will, because it was disposed of absolutely to Sir J. Cobham in the year
1373. Hence there is no reason to conclude from this that there was other
lauded property besides that which is dealt with by the will.
