xxxiv GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

‘Et quia preuisa sic vota facit, puto culpa5'
‘Si bene conseruet ordinis ipse statum.'

In any case it is certain that Gower expressed himself in Latin
with great facility and with tolerable correctness. He may have
imitated the style of Ovid ‘studiosius quam felicius,’ as Leland
observes, but the comparison with other Latin verse-writers of his
time sets his performance in a fairly favourable light.

PROLOGUS LIBRI PR1M1.

From the records of the past we derive examples ; and though credit
be not commonly given to dreams, yet the writers of past time instruct
us otherwise. Daniel and Joseph were taught by visions, and a man's
guardian angel often warns him in his sleep. Hence, as it seems to me,
my dreams should be recorded as signs of the times; and what my
vision was and at what time it came, ye may learn from this book.

If ye desire to know the writer's name, add to solen the beginning
of Gocffrey, the first letter of PVales and the word ter without its head.
But give no praise to the author, sor Ι write not with a view to farne.
I shall write os strange things which my country has experienced, and
as my matter is woful, so also shall be my song. My pen is wet with
tears, and both my heart and my hand tremble; nor am 1 sufficient to
write all the troubles that belong to the time. Ι ask for indulgence
rather than praise: my will is good, though my powers fall short. I
pray that while Ι sing of those true visions which disturb my heart
with terror, he whose name I bear, to whom visions were revealed in
Patmos, may control my work.

CAP. Ι. It was in the fourth year of king Richard, when the month
was June: the moon had set and the morning-star had risen, when
from the West a strange light sprang, the dawn carne from the region
of the setting sun and brought forth the day. The sun shone and all
the earth was bright; Phebus went forth in his glorious car, attended
by the four Seasons, Summer being nearest to him then and honoured
by all creatureS. The meadows were bright with flowers and the flocks
sported in the fields, a perfect paradise of flowers and fruits was there,
with the songs of multitudinous birds. Such was the day on which
I wandered forth for my pleasure.

All things have an end, and at length that calm day had completed
its appointed hours; evening carne and I lay down to rest. The night
came on, dark and gloomy as the day had been bright, and sleep did
not visit my eyes. My hair stood on end, my flesh and my heart
