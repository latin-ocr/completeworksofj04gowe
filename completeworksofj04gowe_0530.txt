420 LAST POEMS. NOTES

and the All Souls book may have been presented to archb1shop
Arundel before the last poems were written.

This concluding piece is written in S in the same hand as the
Epistola at the beginning of the book, the heading apparently over
the writing of another hand, some parts as ‘dicitur,' l. 2, ‘ tripertita—
ternpore,’ 2, 3, being obviously over erasure. The original hand
remains sor ‘est qualiter ab illa Cronica que‚’ ‘in Anglia—rerurn‚'
‘ varia carmina—quia.’

ORATE PRO ANIMA Em (p. 367)

Ι have no doubt that this exhortation was set down by Gower
himself, who had probably arranged before his death for the promised
“ indulgence, following the principle laid down in the last poem of the
collection, of being his own executor in such matters. The verses
‘Armigeri scutum,' δῖα, which are appended in the Glasgow MS. were
originally upon his tomb, and they have every appearance of being his
own composition: cp. p. 352, 11. 217ff. Berthelette after describing
the tornb says, ‘And there by hongeth a table, wherin appereth that
who so euer praith for the soule of John Gower, he shall, so oft as he
so dothe‚ haue a thousande and fyue hundred dayes of pardon.’

PRESUL, OUILE REGIS, Ere. (p.368)

Thisis evidently addressed to archbishop Arundel. The comet referred
to is no doubt that of March, 1402. The evils complained of are the
conspiracies against the king, and we are told by the chroniclers that
the appearance of this comet in the north was taken as a presage ofthe
troubles in VVales and in Northumberland: cp. VValsingham, ii. 248.
Adam of Usk, who saw it when on the Continent, says it was visible by
day as well as by night, and that it probably prefigured the death of
the duke of Milan, whose arms were also seen in the sky (p. 73).

DICUNT SCRIPTURE ETC. (p. 368)

5. The neglect complained of is of prayers for the soul ofthe departed.
Gower seems to have followed his own precept and made arrangements
for some of the prayers in his lifetirne, though others are provided for
by his will. Berthelette in his preface to the Confessio Amantis (1532)
speaks of Gower's place of burial as having been prepared by himselfin
the church of St. Mary Overes, ⁴ where he hath of his ¹owne foundation
a masse dayly songe. And more ouer he hath an obyte yerely done
for hym within the same churche, on fryday after the feaste of thc
blessed pope saynte G1·eg0ry.’ St. Gregory’s day is March 12.
